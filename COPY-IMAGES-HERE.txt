INSTRUCTIONS TO COPY PRODUCT IMAGES:

I've prepared 2 product screenshots for you but I can't copy binary files directly.

Please download these 2 images from our conversation and save them to:
C:\Users\dswann\Documents\GitHub\azure-noob-blog\static\images\products\

FILES NEEDED:
1. kql-cover.png (the dark book cover with goose)
2. kql-results.png (the Azure portal screenshot)

They should be available as download links in the chat above.

Once saved, run:
python freeze.py
git add static/images/products/
git commit -m "Add product screenshots"
git push

Then delete this file.
