## 🔍 KEYWORD RESEARCH NOTES

**High-volume, low-competition opportunities:**
- Migration content (55-606 impressions on various queries!)
- KQL/Log Analytics content (strong positions already)
- Azure pricing/cost content (always in demand)
- Tagging/governance content (14+ impressions, easy rankings)

**Avoid:**
- Generic "azure" terms (too competitive)
- Product announcements (Microsoft owns those)
- Certifications (too crowded)

**Double down on:**
- Enterprise reality posts
- Real-world implementation guides
- Cost/pricing deep dives
- Tools and templates
