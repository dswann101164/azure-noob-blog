## What Makes This a Banger

### 1. Fills a Critical Gap
Every Azure tutorial tells you WHAT each tool does. Nobody honestly tells you WHICH one to learn first and WHY. This post does exactly that with brutal honesty.

### 2. Real-World Authority
- Drawn from managing 44 Azure subscriptions with 31,000+ resources
- Actual production tool usage percentages (Portal 20%, CLI 30%, PowerShell 30%, Terraform 20%)
- Honest admission: "I don't use Bicep in production yet"
- Real debugging scenarios, not theoretical concepts

### 3. Debunks Tool Evangelism
Systematically breaks down what each tool's advocates claim versus operational reality:
- Portal purists vs reality of scale
- CLI evangelists vs pragmatic tool selection
- PowerShell enterprise standard myth
- Bicep future vs current maturity
- Terraform multi-cloud ideology vs actual usage

### 4. Actionable Learning Path
Clear 8-week progression:
- Week 1-2: Portal (learn visually)
- Week 3-4: Azure CLI (command line basics)
- Week 5-6: Bicep OR Terraform (pick one, not both)
- Week 7-8: PowerShell (operational automation)

### 5. Decision Matrix for Real Scenarios
Table showing which tool to use for:
- Learning, querying, deployments, orchestration
- Cost reporting, security remediation
- Multi-cloud vs pure Azure
- CI/CD pipelines
- Troubleshooting

### 6. Addresses Unasked Questions
- "Should I learn ARM templates?" (No, use Bicep)
- "Do I need to know all five tools to get hired?" (No)
- "What if I pick the wrong tool?" (You can't)
- "Should I learn Python instead?" (Only for specific scenarios)

### Controversial Takes
- "Don't learn both Bicep and Terraform simultaneously"

### Email List
Subject: "The Azure tool decision nobody helps you make"
Hook: "Five tools. One you. Which one should you learn first? Here's the answer Microsoft won't give you."
