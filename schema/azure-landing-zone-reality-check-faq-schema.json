      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Azure Landing Zones fail for organizational reasons, not technical ones. Common causes include identity teams on different roadmaps, network engineers stuck in firewall tickets, security teams unfamiliar with Azure, application teams deploying without governance, and tagging standards being ignored after 60 days."

      "name": "How quickly do Azure Landing Zones drift after deployment?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Landing Zone drift typically begins within the first 90 days after go-live. Identity misalignment appears immediately, networking becomes a bottleneck, tagging collapses under operational pressure, and policy enforcement breaks down as teams request exemptions."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What causes Azure Landing Zone tag governance to collapse?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Tag governance collapses because teams create inconsistent tag values without automated remediation. For example, one environment had 247 variations of the Production tag including Prod, PRD, PRODUCTION, and P. Without nightly automated remediation, tagging always degrades."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A survivable Landing Zone requires: (1) Automated tag governance with nightly remediation, (2) Real identity governance with PIM and no permanent privileged roles, (3) Network guardrails that prevent bypassing via public endpoints, (4) Policy plus exemption workflows with 90-day expiration limits, and (5) Centralized observability baseline with AMA onboarding and ARG-based inventory queries."

      "name": "Why do consulting firms' Azure Landing Zone implementations fail?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Consulting engagements deliver beautiful Terraform or Bicep code, 400-page documentation, and perfect architecture diagrams, but leave no operational playbook. Six months after handoff, policies are disabled, tags are inconsistent, shadow resources appear everywhere, and cost reporting breaks because the Landing Zone was never operationalized with ongoing ownership."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How do you prevent Azure Policy from being disabled in a Landing Zone?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Implement a policy lifecycle that includes clear ownership, an approval workflow for changes, exemptions with 90-day maximum expiration, and monthly reviews. Use a ticketing system like ServiceNow for exemption requests with governance team review within 2 business days and monthly reporting to leadership on exemption trends."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Identity misalignment is the number one cause of Landing Zone chaos. Designs assume Entra ID ownership, Conditional Access maturity, and PIM onboarding, but real environments have break-glass accounts everywhere, permanent privileged roles, on-prem sync issues, and shadow admin groups."
