        "text": "Azure OpenAI runs $0.002-$0.06 per 1,000 tokens depending on model (GPT-3.5 to GPT-4), but production deployments cost 10×-50× more than Microsoft's calculator shows. The calculator omits fine-tuning hosting fees ($1,836-$2,160/month per model regardless of usage), infrastructure requirements (Cognitive Services resources, Key Vault, monitoring adding $35-50/month), and the 2× cost multiplier for output tokens versus input tokens. A $4/month calculator estimate becomes $1,900+/month when fine-tuning deploys to production."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Microsoft's Azure Pricing Calculator shows token costs only and assumes: pay-as-you-go token pricing with no fine-tuning, zero infrastructure costs beyond the API, equal input/output token ratios (actual: output tokens cost 2× more), and no hosting fees, monitoring, or supporting services. These assumptions never match production deployments. A typical gap: calculator shows $4/month, actual bill is $1,906/month - a 47,000% difference."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Hidden Azure OpenAI costs include: Fine-tuned model hosting at $1,836/month minimum (charged even if unused), infrastructure overhead of $35/month minimum (Cognitive Services, Key Vault, monitoring), output token premium (costs 2× more than input tokens), retry and error overhead (10-15% additional usage), and supporting services (Virtual Network with private endpoints at $7.20/month, Storage Account for logs at $2-5/month, Azure Monitor at $5-50/month depending on volume). Total hidden costs typically add $1,900-2,000/month to calculator estimates."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "GPT-4 costs 20-30× more than GPT-3.5 per token in Azure OpenAI. GPT-3.5-Turbo pricing: $0.002 per 1K tokens for both input and output. GPT-4 pricing: $0.03 per 1K input tokens, $0.06 per 1K output tokens (8K context). For a production workload processing 1 million tokens per month, GPT-3.5 costs approximately $500-2,000/month while GPT-4 costs $2,000-10,000/month depending on infrastructure and optimization."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Azure OpenAI fine-tuning costs include: Training costs based on tokens in your training file (varies by model), hosting fees of $1,836-$2,160/month per deployed fine-tuned model (charged continuously regardless of usage), and inference costs per 1,000 tokens (separate charges for input and output usage). The hosting hours cost is critical: after a fine-tuned model is deployed, it continues to incur hourly costs even if not actively used. A deployed but inactive fine-tuned model costs $1,836/month with zero API calls."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Five proven strategies to reduce Azure OpenAI costs: 1) Switch 80% of workloads to GPT-3.5 (saves $400/month per workload), 2) Delete unused fine-tuned models (saves $1,836/month per model), 3) Optimize prompt token usage through better prompt engineering (30-40% reduction), 4) Use batch processing for non-real-time workloads (50% discount on token costs), and 5) Negotiate Provisioned Throughput Units (PTU) pricing for production workloads with consistent usage ($2,448/month for predictable capacity vs variable pay-as-you-go). Combined, these strategies reduced our Azure OpenAI spend from $4,200/month to $1,680/month (60% reduction)."
