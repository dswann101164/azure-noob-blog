        "text": "Create a custom Azure Policy that checks for tag name existence (not values) using the exists:false condition, group multiple tag policies into an initiative with two policies per tag (one to apply tags to resource groups, one to inherit tags to child resources), and assign the initiative at management group scope for automatic inheritance to all subscriptions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Using the built-in policy Inherit a tag from the resource group if missing, Azure automatically copies tag names and values from resource groups to new child resources created within them. Existing resources need a separate remediation task. The policy will not overwrite existing tag values on resources."

      "name": "Should I use deny or modify effect for Azure tag policies?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Start with modify effect to automatically apply tags with blank values, reducing friction for users. Switch to deny effect for critical tags that must have specific values like Environment. The modify approach lets users create resources without thinking about tags, while deny forces users to tag correctly during creation."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Start with three core tags: Application or Workload to identify what the resource is for, Environment to distinguish Production, Development, and Test, and CostCenter or Owner to identify who pays. Add more tags later as governance maturity grows."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Create remediation tasks in Policy > Remediation for each tag policy. Azure Policy scans all resource groups in scope and applies missing tag names with blank values. For large environments with 1000+ resources, remediation can take 10-30 minutes. Break large tasks into smaller chunks by subscription to avoid Resource Graph 10,000 result limits."

      "name": "What is an Azure Policy initiative for tags?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "An initiative (policy set) groups multiple tag policies into a single assignment. For three tags you need six total policies: two per tag (one custom policy to apply tags to resource groups, one built-in policy to inherit tags to child resources). Initiative parameters let you change tag names at assignment level without modifying the initiative."
