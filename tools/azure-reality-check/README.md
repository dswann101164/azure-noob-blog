# Azure Reality Check

**Tools to bridge the gap between buzzwords and working infrastructure.**

When leadership says "digital transformation" and technical teams say "leverage Azure Policy" - nobody actually understands each other, but everyone's too proud to admit it.

This repository provides practical tools to break the arrogance cycle in enterprise cloud communications.

## 🎯 The Problem

Corporate culture has made admitting confusion career suicide. So:

- Leadership uses **business buzzwords** to hide gaps in technical understanding
- Technical teams use **technical jargon** to hide gaps in business understanding
- Consultants use **both** because they're paid by complexity
- Everyone nods, nobody admits confusion, projects fail

**This isn't about intelligence. It's about arrogance.**

## 💡 The Solution

Make honesty safer than arrogance:

### For Leaders:
- Ask clarifying questions without fear
- Admit technical gaps openly
- Request examples of what "done" looks like
- Value understanding over sounding strategic

### For Technical Teams:
- Ask about business context without shame
- Admit business gaps openly  
- Provide examples of what you're building
- Value clarity over sounding expert

### For Everyone:
- Document assumptions in writing
- Confirm understanding before starting work
- Build prototypes before committing to timelines
- Make "I don't know" a safe answer
