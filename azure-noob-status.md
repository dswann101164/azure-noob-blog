## Recent Wins (Past Week)

### October 14, 2025 - Two Major Posts

**Post 1: "If You Can't Code Your Architecture"**
- Deploy one VM to learn variables
- Deploy three VMs to learn you're wasting time
- Code your fourth deployment or admit you're clicking buttons for a living
- Strong career/architecture positioning
- Covers Terraform, IaC, automation mindset

**Post 2: "Why Your Azure Migration ROI Calculation Is Wrong"**
- Finance compares server costs ($1,840 vs $1,680), declares cloud expensive
- Misses: 6-month procurement cycles, VAR meetings ($22K per cycle), hardware refresh elimination
- **NEW SECTION:** "Stop Holding Your Breath" - operational anxiety of aging hardware
- Quantified admin time: 15-20 hrs/month per admin on hardware babysitting = $72K-96K annually
- Marketplace revolution: 3-month software procurement → 15 minutes
- **This is a banger** - arms IT with ammunition for Finance conversations

## Content Patterns That Work

### Structure (Validated Across 29 Posts)
1. **Lead with the problem** - Real scenario, preferably from actual work
2. **Provide concrete numbers** - Not "saves time" but "6 months → same day"
3. **Show the code** - Full working examples, never fragments
4. **Explain the gap** - What Finance/Leadership doesn't see
5. **Give the solution** - Actionable, specific, reproducible

### Writing Style (Consistent Winners)
- Direct, no fluff or filler
- Lead with problem, not theory
- Assume reader is smart but new to topic
- Code-heavy with clear explanations
- Honest about failures and debugging process
- Proper attribution to sources
- Full working code examples (never placeholders)
- **Quantify everything possible** (time, cost, labor hours)

### Topics That Resonate Strongest
1. **Leadership/Finance gap posts** (ROI, CMDB, Migration failure)
2. **Operational reality vs documentation** (Private endpoints, CAF, Microsoft docs)
3. **Tools that solve real problems** (IPAM, Workbooks, KQL queries)
4. **Career positioning** (If you can't code, you're not an architect)

## Current Projects & Status

### Active Work
- **Tag Repair:** Still circular dependency problem (need clean tags to justify FinOps Toolkit, need Toolkit to fix tags at scale)
- **Chris Bowman Dashboard:** Already published (Oct 2)
- **Blog Infrastructure:** Flask + Frozen-Flask → GitHub Pages working smoothly
- **Email Capture:** Netlify forms active on KQL Cheat Sheet, tracking signups

### Technical Stack Status
- **Deployment:** Working flawlessly
- **Publishing Workflow:** Established and consistent (write → freeze → commit → push)
- **Local Testing:** `flask run` → `python freeze.py` → commit → push
- **Hero Images:** SVG generation working well for recent posts

---

## Metrics to Track

### Primary Metrics
- **Publishing Consistency:** 2+ posts/week ✅ (currently exceeding target)
- **Email Signups:** From KQL Cheat Sheet capture form (conversion metric for content value)
- **Original Pipeline Completion:** 8/8 topics complete ✅

### Secondary Metrics (When Analytics Added)
- Traffic sources (LinkedIn unavailable, organic/direct only)
- Most popular posts (double down on what works)
- Time on page (content quality indicator)

---

## Topic Pipeline (Future Posts)

### Near-Term Ideas
Content is flowing naturally from work. No forced topics needed. Current approach working:
1. Hit real problem at Synovus
2. Solve it
3. Document solution with full context
4. Publish

### Patterns to Continue
- **Leadership gap posts** (Finance/IT perspective differences) - strong resonance
- **Operational reality** (what actually works vs what docs say)
- **Career positioning** (architecture, coding, professional development)
- **Tools from work** (anything built to solve 31K resource scale problems)

---

## Synovus Context (Relevant to Content)

### Work Environment
- **Role:** Azure Architect at regional bank
- **Remote worker:** All work done remotely via WVD
- **Lab environment:** Full Azure tenant separate from production (can iterate fast)
- **Scale:** 31,000+ resources, 44 subscriptions being consolidated, 21 AD domains
- **Constraint:** Cannot use LinkedIn due to company policy (blog is primary platform)

### Job Security
- Synovus merging with Pinnacle Financial Q1 2026
- Job secure - one of only 2 cloud experts
- Position strengthens through merger
- Migration project provides continuous content

### Active Migration Project
- **Scale:** 44 subscriptions, 21 AD domains, 300+ applications
- **Infrastructure:** Dual ExpressRoute circuits, VMware bridge to on-premises
- **Timeline:** Q1 2026 merger
- **Content goldmine:** Real operational problems at enterprise scale

## Session Notes (October 14, 2025)

### Today's Progress
- Completed original pipeline (all 8 topics published)
- Published two major posts in one session
- Added "operational stability" section to ROI post based on feedback
- Total posts: 29 (vs 11-12 thought we had on Oct 5)

### Key Insights
- **Architecture post:** Strong career positioning, fills gap in "why you must code"
- **ROI post:** Quantifies invisible costs Finance never sees, arms IT for budget conversations
- **"Holding your breath" framing:** Visceral, everyone who's run on-prem has lived this
- Both posts fill content gaps in industry (vendor content too abstract, these are concrete)

### Velocity Analysis
- Started Oct 5 thinking: 11-12 posts, 7 weeks in
- Actually on Oct 14: 29 posts, 10 weeks in
- **Reality:** Publishing closer to 3 posts/week, not 2
- Quality hasn't dropped - posts are getting BETTER with more concrete numbers

### What Changed Since Last Status
- Realized we'd published way more than documented (18 posts undercounted!)
- Original pipeline complete (was thinking 1-2 topics left, actually 0)
- Content velocity accelerating, not slowing down
- Posts getting more detailed with better quantification
