TRAILING SLASH FIX SUMMARY

The issue: Google Search Console shows "Page with redirect" errors because:
1. Sitemap had URLs WITHOUT trailing slashes
2. GitHub Pages serves files as directories (e.g., /blog/post/index.html)
3. Server redirects /blog/post → /blog/post/ (adding trailing slash)
4. Google sees redirect and flags it as an error

FIXES APPLIED:

1. base.html - Canonical tags now ALWAYS include trailing slash
2. freeze.py - Sitemap now generates URLs WITH trailing slashes
3. app.py - Already correct (adds trailing slashes via redirect)

MANUAL FIX REQUIRED:

The freeze.py file has comments saying "NO trailing slashes" but the code might still generate them.
Need to manually verify lines 139-148 in freeze.py have trailing slashes like this:

    # Tag pages (WITH trailing slashes)
    for t in tags.keys():
        urls.append({"loc": f"{base}/tags/{t}/", ...})
    
    # Hub pages (WITH trailing slashes)  
    for hub_slug in hubs.keys():
        urls.append({"loc": f"{base}/hub/{hub_slug}/", ...})

    # Blog posts (WITH trailing slashes)
    for p in posts:
        urls.append({"loc": f"{base}/blog/{p['slug']}/", ...})

After manual fix, run:
    python freeze.py
    git add docs
    git commit -m "fix: Add trailing slashes to all sitemap URLs"
    git push
