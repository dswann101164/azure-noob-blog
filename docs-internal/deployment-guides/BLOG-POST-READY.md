### 2. Freeze & Publish
```powershell
# In your azure-noob-blog directory
cd C:\Users\dswann\Documents\GitHub\azure-noob-blog

# Freeze the site
python freeze.py

# Commit and push
git add posts static/images
git commit -m "Add blog post: Azure dashboard rebranding tool"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Update GitHub Repo (Optional but Recommended)

- [ ] Public on GitHub
- [ ] Has the latest `Rebrand-AzureDashboard.ps1` script
- [ ] Includes your logo.png
- [ ] Has a good README (it does!)
