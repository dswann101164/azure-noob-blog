## Week 2: Community Validation (Nov 11-17)

### Reddit Strategy
**Subreddits to target:**
- r/AZURE (150K members)
- r/devops (200K members)  
- r/sysadmin (500K members)
- r/programming (7M members - if it gains traction)

**Post Template:**
```
Title: "Microsoft says 'one subscription per workload' - here's why that's wrong in DevOps"

Body:
I just published a deep-dive on software rationalization for multi-subscription Azure environments. 

The TL;DR: If you're doing security-zoned subscriptions (dev/test/prod), you CAN'T track costs by application unless you use AppID tags consistently.

GitHub repo with working code: [link]

Happy to answer questions.

## Risk Mitigation

### LinkedIn Restriction
**Problem:** Can't share on LinkedIn due to Synovus
**Solution:**
- Focus on Reddit, GitHub, and anonymous channels
- Build organic search traffic (SEO)
- Rely on others to share (make it share-worthy)

### Controversial Takes
**Risk:** "Microsoft is lying" might upset people
**Mitigation:**
- It's technically accurate (misleading guidance)
- Provides solutions, not just complaints
- Backs up claims with code

### Negative Feedback
**If someone disagrees:**
- Respond professionally
- Ask for their experience
- Update post if they have valid points
- Turn disagreement into discussion

## The Viral Formula

**What makes content shareable:**

1. ✅ **Strong Opinion**: "Microsoft is lying"
2. ✅ **Real Problem**: Everyone feels this pain
3. ✅ **Actionable Solution**: Not just theory - actual code
4. ✅ **Manifesto**: Printable one-liner
5. ✅ **Professional Value**: Architects can use this at work

**Missing piece:** Visual/video content

### Quick Win: Create Shareable Graphics

**Graphic 1: The Problem**
```
[Image: Confused architect]
Question: "How much does App X cost?"
Answer: "¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Caption: "If this is you, read this."
```

**Graphic 2: The Manifesto**
```
[Clean typography]
"Subscriptions are for security.
AppID is for truth.
Everything else is noise."
```

**Graphic 3: Before/After**
```
Before: 800 apps, $2.5M, 0% visibility
After: 400 apps, $1.7M, 95% visibility
Savings: $800K
```
