## Current Traffic Reality

**Last 3 months:**
- Total clicks: 78
- Total impressions: 7,448
- Overall CTR: 1.05%
- Average position: 16.91

**The core problem:** Google is showing your content (7,448 impressions) but users aren't clicking. You're ranking on page 2-3 for high-value queries.

## Why This Will Work

**Problem diagnosis:**
- Not a content volume problem (233 pages indexed)
- Not a discovery problem (7,448 impressions)
- **It's an optimization problem** - wrong titles, wrong structure, ranking on page 2-3

**Solution:**
- AEO-structured content (AI-friendly + human-friendly)
- Titles that match actual search intent
- Direct answers at the top
- Better internal linking

**The opportunity:**
You have 10 queries with 50+ impressions each already. You're being shown for the right queries - just need to rank higher and get clicks.
