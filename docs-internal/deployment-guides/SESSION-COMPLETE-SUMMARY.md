## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **Hub assignment is critical** - Posts must be both (a) have `hub: X` in front matter AND (b) be listed in hubs_config.py
2. **Freeze before commit** - Always run `python freeze.py` before git operations
3. **Exact text search > line numbers** - Use actual text strings for file edits, not approximate line numbers
4. **Audit before implementation** - Checking actual files prevents duplicate work
5. **Git status is truth** - If git shows no changes, the files are already committed
