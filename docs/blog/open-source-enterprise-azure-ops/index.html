    <h1>Why I Open-Sourced My Enterprise Azure Operations Repository</h1>
<p><strong>This is a follow-up to <a href="/blog/the-ai-admin/">The AI Admin: Stop Being a Human API Wrapper</a></strong></p>
<p>Yesterday I wrote about how AI is eliminating operational toil in Azure administration - the shift from manual execution to AI-assisted automation. Today I'm sharing what I built <em>using</em> that AI-assisted workflow: an open-source repository of enterprise Azure operational patterns.</p>
<p>I just published <a href="https://github.com/dswann101164/azure-enterprise-ops">azure-enterprise-ops</a> on GitHub. It contains the operational templates, KQL queries, Terraform patterns, and MCP server configurations I use to manage 44 Azure subscriptions with 31,000+ resources during a major bank merger.</p>
<p><strong>This isn't a portfolio project. This is production code.</strong></p>
<p>Most Azure architects guard this stuff like trade secrets. I'm publishing it because I have a thesis: <em>operational knowledge compounds faster when it's shared than when it's hoarded.</em></p>
<p>And here's the meta-lesson: <strong>AI accelerated this transformation from private notes to public repository by 5x.</strong> What would have taken 200+ hours of manual work took 40 hours with AI assistance.</p>
<p>This post documents both <em>what</em> I'm sharing and <em>how</em> AI helped me build portable intellectual property.</p>
<h2>The Documentation Gap Nobody Talks About</h2>
<p>Microsoft's Azure documentation is excellent at showing you how to create resources. Here's how to deploy a VM. Here's how to configure a VNet. Here's how to set up Key Vault.</p>
<p><strong>What it doesn't show you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Which subscription goes in which management group when you have 44 of them?</li>
<li>How do you allocate costs when applications span multiple subscriptions?</li>
<li>What's your NSG rule strategy across an entire enterprise?</li>
<li>How do you migrate 21 Active Directory domains during a merger?</li>
<li>How do you actually implement FinOps at scale?</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud Adoption Framework? Great theory. Doesn't tell you how to handle the political reality of cost allocation when Finance wants chargebacks but application teams don't tag resources.</p>
<p>MVPs blog about new features. They don't blog about "here's how we finally got everyone to tag their resources after 18 months of fighting."</p>
<p>Certification courses teach you concepts. They don't teach you "here's the KQL query you'll run 50 times a week for the next three years."</p>
<p><strong>That gap? That's where actual value lives.</strong></p>
<h2>What I'm Sharing (And Why)</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dswann101164/azure-enterprise-ops">azure-enterprise-ops</a> repository contains:</p>
<h3>Documentation (<code>/docs</code>)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecture Patterns</strong>: Hub-spoke networking at scale, governance structures, migration strategies</li>
<li><strong>Security Operations</strong>: Real NSG rules (not "allow all from 10.0.0.0/8"), Key Vault patterns, Azure AD integration</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting Guide</strong>: Common production issues with actual fixes</li>
<li><strong>MCP Servers</strong>: AI-assisted Azure administration workflows (the infrastructure from <a href="/blog/the-ai-admin/">The AI Admin</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples (<code>/examples</code>)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation Scenarios</strong>: End-to-end PowerShell and Terraform patterns</li>
<li><strong>Cost Analysis</strong>: KQL queries for FinOps, cost allocation strategies, budget automation</li>
<li><strong>Resource Queries</strong>: Azure Resource Graph queries for inventory, compliance, and analysis</li>
</ul>
<h3>Terraform (<code>/terraform</code>)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Production-ready infrastructure code</li>
<li>Modular design patterns</li>
<li>Variables and outputs for reuse</li>
<li>Key Vault integration</li>
</ul>
<h3>MCP Integration (<code>/mcp</code>)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Model Context Protocol server configs</li>
<li>AI-powered Azure operations workflows</li>
<li>The actual configuration I use for AI-assisted administration</li>
</ul>
<h2>The "Portable IP" Strategy</h2>
<p>Here's my career thesis: <strong>I can't take proprietary code with me when I leave a job, but I can take patterns and knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>Every time I solve a problem at work, I ask: "Can I generalize this?"</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific to my company? Stays private.</li>
<li>Generic operational pattern? Gets documented and published.</li>
</ul>
<p>This repository is the result of that practice. I've sanitized every reference to:<br />
- Company names<br />
- Specific resource counts<br />
- Internal tooling<br />
- Proprietary configurations</p>
<p>What remains is pure operational knowledge: <em>how you actually run Azure at enterprise scale</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters for you:</strong></p>
<p>If you're managing Azure in a regulated industry, you're probably solving similar problems to me. Financial services, healthcare, government - we all deal with:<br />
- Multi-subscription governance<br />
- Complex cost allocation<br />
- Merger and acquisition scenarios<br />
- Hybrid cloud integration<br />
- Compliance requirements</p>
<p>Publishing this means:<br />
1. You get working solutions to common problems<br />
2. I get feedback and contributions<br />
3. We both get professional visibility for knowing this stuff<br />
4. The knowledge compounds as others add their patterns</p>
<h2>How AI Accelerated This (The Meta-Lesson)</h2>
<p>Building this repository took about 40 hours of work. Without AI, it would have taken 200+.</p>
<p><strong>This is the AI Admin strategy in practice:</strong> I used the same AI tooling I wrote about in <a href="/blog/the-ai-admin/">yesterday's post</a> to accelerate my own content creation workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Here's my actual workflow:</strong></p>
<h3>Phase 1: Content Generation (AI-Assisted)</h3>
<p>I gave Claude Desktop access to my internal documentation and said "help me turn this into publishable content."</p>
<p>It:<br />
- Extracted patterns from company-specific examples<br />
- Converted internal wikis to markdown<br />
- Reorganized content for external audiences<br />
- Suggested structure and navigation</p>
<p><strong>Human time: ~8 hours of review and direction</strong><br />
<strong>AI time: Instant transformations that would've been 50+ hours of manual work</strong></p>
<h3>Phase 2: Sanitization (AI-Powered)</h3>
<p>I built PowerShell scripts with AI to:<br />
- Find and replace company-specific terms<br />
- Convert real resource names to generic examples<br />
- Strip internal identifiers<br />
- Verify no sensitive data remained</p>
<p><strong>Human time: ~2 hours writing sanitization requirements</strong><br />
<strong>AI time: Generated scripts that would've taken 20 hours to write manually</strong></p>
<h3>Phase 3: Documentation (AI-Enhanced)</h3>
<p>Claude helped me:<br />
- Write comprehensive READMEs<br />
- Create contribution guidelines<br />
- Add inline code comments<br />
- Generate setup instructions</p>
<p><strong>Human time: ~5 hours of review and editing</strong><br />
<strong>AI time: Draft generation that saved 30+ hours</strong></p>
<h3>Phase 4: Repository Structure (AI-Designed)</h3>
<p>I described my goals and constraints. Claude suggested:<br />
- Folder organization<br />
- File naming conventions<br />
- README structure<br />
- .gitignore patterns</p>
<p><strong>Human time: ~2 hours of implementation</strong><br />
<strong>AI time: Architecture design that would've taken 10+ hours of research</strong></p>
<p><strong>Total: 40 hours of human work instead of 200+</strong></p>
<p>The AI didn't write the operational knowledge - I built that over three years. But it accelerated the transformation from "private notes" to "publishable repository" by 5x.</p>
<p><strong>This is what I meant by "AI Admin"</strong> - not letting AI replace you, but using AI to eliminate toil so you can focus on higher-value work. In this case, the higher-value work was deciding <em>what</em> to share and <em>how</em> to position it. AI handled the execution layer.</p>
<h2>The "Applications, Not Subscriptions" Insight</h2>
<p>Here's the single most valuable pattern in this repository:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft's cost management is built around subscriptions. But applications are your real organizational unit.</strong></p>
<p>When you have 44 subscriptions, you don't care about "Subscription XYZ spent $50K this month." You care about "The Customer Portal application spent $50K across three subscriptions."</p>
<p>Cloud Adoption Framework doesn't cover this. Certification courses don't teach it. Vendor consultants won't tell you (because it makes their billing complicated).</p>
<p><strong>But it's the fundamental reality of enterprise cost management.</strong></p>
<p>The repository includes:<br />
- KQL queries to aggregate costs by application<br />
- Tagging strategies for cross-subscription applications<br />
- PowerShell automation for cost allocation<br />
- Terraform patterns for application-centric resource organization</p>
<p>This one pattern has saved our organization hundreds of hours of manual cost allocation work.</p>
<h2>Why Most People Don't Share This</h2>
<p><strong>"If I share my expertise, I lose my competitive advantage."</strong></p>
<p>I hear this constantly. Here's why it's wrong:</p>
<h3>1. Knowledge Compounds, It Doesn't Deplete</h3>
<p>Publishing this doesn't make me know less. It makes the community know more. And when the community knows more, I benefit from their contributions and improvements.</p>
<h3>2. Execution Matters More Than Knowledge</h3>
<p>Knowing <em>how</em> to implement FinOps at scale is different from <em>actually doing it</em> under political pressure, budget constraints, and legacy technical debt.</p>
<p>Publishing the "how" doesn't eliminate the value of the "doing it."</p>
<h3>3. Shared Context Creates Opportunities</h3>
<p>When someone sees this repository and thinks "this person actually understands enterprise Azure operations," that's a professional connection I wouldn't have had otherwise.</p>
<p>Can't use LinkedIn due to company policy. This repository is my professional visibility.</p>
<h3>4. Real Expertise Can't Be Copied</h3>
<p>The patterns in this repository represent three years of production experience. You can read them in an hour. Understanding when to apply them, how to adapt them, and what trade-offs matter - that takes experience.</p>
<p>Publishing the patterns doesn't make me replaceable. It proves I've done the work.</p>
<h2>What This Means for You</h2>
<h3>If You're Managing Azure at Scale</h3>
<p>Clone the repository. Use the KQL queries. Adapt the Terraform patterns. Submit pull requests with your own improvements.</p>
<p>Enterprise Azure operations is a small community. We're all solving similar problems. Sharing solutions benefits everyone.</p>
<h3>If You're Building Your Career</h3>
<p>This is a template for building portable intellectual property:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Document everything you learn</strong> (even if it's just notes to yourself)</li>
<li><strong>Extract the patterns</strong> (what's specific vs. what's general?)</li>
<li><strong>Publish the general knowledge</strong> (GitHub, blog posts, speaking)</li>
<li><strong>Maintain separation</strong> (company IP stays private)</li>
<li><strong>Build in public</strong> (let AI accelerate the transformation)</li>
</ol>
<p>Your expertise is valuable. Make it visible.</p>
<h3>If You're Learning Azure</h3>
<p>Start with the <code>/examples</code> folder. Those are working solutions to common problems.</p>
<p>Don't just read them. Run them. Modify them. Break them. Understand why they work.</p>
<p>The best way to learn Azure isn't certification courses. It's reading production code and operational documentation from people who actually run this stuff.</p>

<h2>The AI-Assisted Future</h2>
<p>As I wrote in <a href="/blog/the-ai-admin/">The AI Admin</a>, traditional Azure administration is becoming AI-assisted automation. That's not a threat - it's an opportunity.</p>
<p>When AI can handle 75-90% of routine Azure administration tasks, the value shifts from <em>execution</em> to:<br />
- <strong>Pattern recognition</strong>: Knowing which approach fits which scenario<br />
- <strong>Architectural decisions</strong>: Understanding trade-offs at scale<br />
- <strong>Process design</strong>: Automating workflows end-to-end<br />
- <strong>Knowledge sharing</strong>: Teaching AI (and humans) better patterns</p>
<p>This repository is my contribution to that shift. Instead of hoarding operational knowledge, I'm sharing it so:<br />
- You can train AI agents with better patterns<br />
- Junior engineers can learn from production examples<br />
- The Azure community has real operational documentation<br />
- We all benefit from shared expertise</p>
<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p><strong>Want more content like this?</strong> This blog covers real-world Azure operational challenges that vendor documentation doesn't. No basic tutorials. No certification prep. Just the stuff that actually matters when you're managing Azure at scale.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>The gap between "tutorial complete" and "production at 3 AM"</strong> is where real value lives</li>
<li><strong>Applications, not subscriptions</strong> are your organizational unit for cost management</li>
<li><strong>Operational knowledge compounds</strong> when shared, not when hoarded</li>
<li><strong>AI accelerates</strong> the transformation from private notes to publishable content (5x faster)</li>
<li><strong>Portable intellectual property</strong> is the career strategy for 2025+</li>
<li><strong>Real expertise</strong> is proven through execution, not protected by secrecy</li>
<li><strong>AI Admin strategy in practice</strong>: Use AI to eliminate toil, focus on strategy</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Star the repo</strong> if you find it useful. The GitHub algorithm rewards engagement, and that helps others discover operational content.</p>
<p><strong>Share your own patterns</strong> via pull requests. We all benefit when we share what actually works.</p>
