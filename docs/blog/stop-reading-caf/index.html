  <div class="post-body">
    <p>A colleague reached out last week.</p>
<p>"Someone sent me this skills assessment. Says it's from the Cloud Adoption Framework. Can you take a look?"</p>
<p>I opened the spreadsheet.</p>
<p><strong>68 skills to assess their Azure team:</strong><br />
- HTML<br />
- C++ / .NET / Java<br />
- Intent-Based Networking<br />
- Edge Computing<br />
- Container-Native Storage<br />
- Node.js</p>
<p>I looked at the list for a minute, then replied:</p>
<p>"This isn't CAF. This isn't even Azure."</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Microsoft publishes the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure. It's comprehensive. It's detailed. It's <strong>1,500 pages long</strong>.</p>
<p>Leadership hears "Use the Cloud Adoption Framework" and thinks they need a skills assessment.</p>
<p>So they Google "cloud skills matrix."</p>
<p>They find a consultant template. Or a Gartner report. Or some generic "IT transformation" spreadsheet.</p>
<p>They download 68 skills including HTML, C++, and "Intent-Based Networking."</p>
<p>They send it to their Azure team for assessment.</p>
<p>And now nobody knows what's actually required to run Azure.</p>
<h2>What's Missing From That Spreadsheet</h2>
<p>That 68-skill assessment didn't mention:<br />
- <strong>Management Groups</strong> - The foundation of Azure hierarchy<br />
- <strong>Azure Policy</strong> - How governance actually works<br />
- <strong>Landing Zones</strong> - The core CAF concept<br />
- <strong>RBAC</strong> - Azure's security model<br />
- <strong>Resource Graph / KQL</strong> - How you query Azure at scale<br />
- <strong>Private Endpoints</strong> - Enterprise networking reality<br />
- <strong>Tags</strong> - How you track cost and ownership</p>
<p>These aren't optional Azure skills. These are <strong>the actual framework</strong>.</p>
<h2>What CAF Actually Is</h2>
<p>My dad always told me: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it."</p>
<p>Microsoft's CAF is 1,500 pages because they're covering every enterprise scenario. But at its core, CAF is <strong>3 layers</strong>:</p>
<h3><strong>Layer 1: Structure</strong> (How Azure Is Organized)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Management Groups</strong> - Hierarchy for policies and RBAC</li>
<li><strong>Subscriptions</strong> - Billing and access boundaries</li>
<li><strong>Resource Groups</strong> - Logical containers for resources</li>
<li><strong>Naming Conventions</strong> - Consistent identification</li>
</ul>
<p>Without structure, Azure becomes chaos. Everything else builds on this foundation.</p>
<h3><strong>Layer 2: Governance</strong> (What's Allowed and Who Can Do It)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure Policy</strong> - Enforce rules automatically (not asking nicely)</li>
<li><strong>RBAC</strong> - Control who can do what (not making everyone Owner)</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong> - Track ownership, cost centers, environments</li>
</ul>
<p>Without governance, you're manually trying to enforce rules. With governance, the platform enforces them for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Layer 3: Operations</strong> (Keeping It Running)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitoring &amp; Alerts</strong> - Know when things break</li>
<li><strong>Backup &amp; Recovery</strong> - Protect against disasters</li>
<li><strong>Cost Management</strong> - Understand where money goes</li>
<li><strong>Security Center</strong> - Detect and respond to threats</li>
</ul>
<p>Without operations, you're reactive. With operations, you're proactive.</p>
<p><strong>That's CAF.</strong></p>
<p>Everything else in those 1,500 pages is:<br />
- Examples of the above three layers<br />
- Methodology and planning frameworks<br />
- Workload-specific guidance (AKS, SQL, etc.)<br />
- Consultant engagement processes</p>
<h2>What CAF Operations Actually Look Like</h2>
<p>When I write down what CAF means in practice, it's not 68 buzzwords.</p>
<p>It's <strong>58 specific Azure governance operations</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Management &amp; Governance:</strong><br />
- Create, modify, delete Management Groups<br />
- Create, modify, delete Subscriptions<br />
- Create Azure Policy for security and compliance<br />
- Assign Azure Policy to enforce requirements<br />
- Create RBAC Role Definitions<br />
- Assign RBAC Role Assignments</p>
<p><strong>Networking:</strong><br />
- Create ExpressRoute Circuits<br />
- Create Virtual Network Gateways (S2S/P2S VPN)<br />
- Create Virtual Networks, Subnets, Route Tables<br />
- Configure Network Security Groups<br />
- Deploy Private Link Endpoints<br />
- Configure Service Endpoints</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong><br />
- Administer Azure AD Privileged Identity Management<br />
- Create Conditional Access Policies<br />
- Manage Security Center Alerts<br />
- Configure Key Vault secrets, keys, certificates<br />
- Monitor compliance requirements</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong><br />
- Create Virtual Machines, Availability Sets, VMSS<br />
- Configure Load Balancers<br />
- Manage Public IP Addresses<br />
- Create Log Analytics Workspaces<br />
- Configure Azure SQL Servers<br />
- Manage Storage Accounts<br />
- Implement Backup and Recovery</p>
<p>...and 30+ more operations across identity, data, monitoring, and compliance.</p>
<p><strong>This is what CAF governance actually means.</strong></p>
<p>Not "Do you know HTML?"</p>
<p><em>Need to assign these 58 operations to actual people? I've created a <a href="/blog/it-roles-responsibilities-matrix/">CAF-aligned Roles &amp; Responsibilities Matrix</a> that maps every operation to roles like Azure Admin, Security Engineer, and Platform Engineer. It's the practical RACI matrix Microsoft never published. Available as downloadable Excel and PDF templates.</em></p>
<h2>Why This Keeps Happening</h2>
<p>Leadership gets directive: "Use the Cloud Adoption Framework"</p>
<p>They think: "I need to assess my team's skills"</p>
<p>They Google: "cloud skills assessment template"</p>
<p>They find: Generic IT transformation consultant spreadsheet</p>
<p>They send it out</p>
<p>The team looks at "Intent-Based Networking" and "Edge Computing" and thinks: "What does this have to do with creating Management Groups?"</p>
<p><strong>The disconnect:</strong><br />
- CAF is <strong>Azure-specific</strong> governance and operations<br />
- Generic templates are <strong>vendor marketing buzzwords</strong><br />
- One teaches you Landing Zones and Azure Policy<br />
- The other asks if you know C++</p>
<p>Leadership can't tell the difference because CAF is 1,500 pages of Microsoft enterprise jargon.</p>
<h2>What Your Team Actually Needs</h2>
<p>Not a 68-skill buzzword assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Three questions:</strong></p>
<h3><strong>1. Can your team structure Azure correctly?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Management Groups for hierarchy</li>
<li>Subscriptions as boundaries</li>
<li>Resource Groups for organization</li>
<li>Naming conventions that scale</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If no:</strong> 3-6 months to learn while doing real work</p>
<h3><strong>2. Can your team implement governance?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Azure Policy to enforce rules automatically</li>
<li>RBAC without making everyone Owner</li>
<li>Tags for cost tracking and ownership</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If no:</strong> 3-6 months to learn while implementing</p>
<h3><strong>3. Can your team handle enterprise operations?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Private Endpoints and hybrid networking</li>
<li>Resource Graph queries at scale</li>
<li>Monitoring and alerting</li>
<li>Backup and disaster recovery</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If no:</strong> 6-12 months to learn through real projects</p>
<p>These aren't skills you assess on a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>These are capabilities you build by doing the work.</p>
<h2>What CAF Doesn't Tell You</h2>
<p>CAF is a <strong>strategy framework</strong> for enterprises.</p>
<p>It assumes:<br />
- Unlimited budget<br />
- Dedicated teams for each function<br />
- 18-month planning cycles<br />
- Leadership understanding cloud concepts</p>
<p>Real Azure work looks different:<br />
- Small teams doing everything<br />
- Production is on fire right now<br />
- You're migrating subscriptions while keeping things running<br />
- Leadership thinks CAF is an org chart template</p>
<p><strong>CAF won't change your team size or timeline.</strong></p>
<p>What changes the timeline:<br />
- Months of hands-on work<br />
- Breaking things in test environments<br />
- Opening Microsoft tickets when stuck (the 3-hour rule: if you can't solve it in 3 hours, escalate)<br />
- Learning Resource Graph by writing queries<br />
- Implementing Landing Zones on real infrastructure</p>
<p>You don't learn Management Groups from a skills assessment.</p>
<p>You learn them by creating them, breaking them, and fixing them.</p>
<h2>The Simple Truth</h2>
<p>CAF isn't wrong. It's just written for the wrong audience.</p>
<p>Microsoft writes for enterprise architects planning 2-year transformations.</p>
<p>Consultants write to sell implementation services.</p>
<p>Leadership wants a checklist to assess their team.</p>
<p><strong>What's missing:</strong></p>
<p>Page 1 should say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"CAF is 3 layers: Structure, Governance, Operations.</p>
<p>Structure = Management Groups, Subscriptions, Resource Groups, Names</p>
<p>Governance = Policy, RBAC, Tags</p>
<p>Operations = Monitor, Backup, Cost, Security</p>
<p>Everything else is examples and methodology.</p>
<p>You need people who can:<br />
- Create Management Groups<br />
- Write Azure Policy<br />
- Configure RBAC correctly<br />
- Query Resource Graph<br />
- Handle Private Endpoints</p>
<p>If your team can't do these, they need 6-12 months of hands-on work.</p>
<p>No skills assessment changes that timeline."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that's not on page 1.</p>
<p>It's somewhere in the middle of 1,500 pages.</p>
<h2>What To Do Instead</h2>
<p>If someone sends you a "CAF skills assessment" that asks about HTML, Edge Computing, or Intent-Based Networking:</p>
<p><strong>Ignore it.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can we create and manage Management Groups?</strong> Yes / No / Learning</li>
<li><strong>Can we write Azure Policy that enforces compliance?</strong> Yes / No / Learning</li>
<li><strong>Can we implement RBAC without security holes?</strong> Yes / No / Learning</li>
<li><strong>Can we configure Private Endpoints for enterprise networking?</strong> Yes / No / Learning</li>
<li><strong>Can we query Resource Graph at scale?</strong> Yes / No / Learning</li>
<li><strong>Can we implement Landing Zones correctly?</strong> Yes / No / Learning</li>
</ol>
<p>Those six questions tell you everything about CAF readiness.</p>
<p>The other 62 skills on that spreadsheet? Consultant fluff.</p>
<p><strong>Next step:</strong> Once you've answered these questions, use my <a href="/blog/it-roles-responsibilities-matrix/">CAF Roles &amp; Responsibilities Matrix</a> to assign specific owners to each operation. It's the spreadsheet you can't find anywhere else - a practical RACI for all 58 CAF operations.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>You can't Google your way to an Azure team.</p>
<p>But leadership will keep trying.</p>
<p>They'll download "cloud skills matrices" that ask about Node.js and Edge Computing.</p>
<p>They'll think organization charts and frameworks create skills.</p>
<p>They'll believe CAF is a 68-point assessment instead of 3 foundational layers.</p>
<p><strong>Your job:</strong></p>
<p>Simplify it.</p>
<p>"CAF is Structure, Governance, and Operations.</p>
<p>We can do some of it. We're learning the rest.</p>
<p>It takes 6-12 months of real work to build these capabilities.</p>
<p>No spreadsheet changes that."</p>
<p>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it.</p>
<p>CAF is simple.</p>
<p>Microsoft just forgot to say so on page 1.</p>
