    <h1>The Three AI Operations Roles That Don't Exist Yet (But Will in 12 Months)</h1>
<p>I searched for "AI operations governance jobs" on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Found nothing.</p>
<p>Searched for "AI security engineer" focused on AI tool governance.</p>
<p>Found generic cybersecurity roles. Nothing about monitoring ChatGPT usage.</p>
<p>Searched for "AI business analyst" for operations intelligence.</p>
<p>Found data science roles. Nothing about measuring AI efficiency in Azure operations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at my company - a regulated enterprise - we're adopting AI tools for Azure operations with zero formal governance structure.</p>
<p>Someone needs to monitor what people are asking AI.</p>
<p>Someone needs to prevent credentials from being pasted into ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Someone needs to measure if AI tools are actually worth the investment.</p>
<p>Those three "someones" aren't official roles yet.</p>
<p>But they will be.</p>
<p>And if you position yourself now, you'll define what those roles become.</p>
<h2>The Problem Nobody's Formally Solving</h2>
<p>Here's what's happening right now at most enterprises:</p>
<p><strong>Engineers are using AI tools:</strong><br />
- ChatGPT for PowerShell generation<br />
- Claude for KQL query writing<br />
- GitHub Copilot for infrastructure code<br />
- AI assistants for troubleshooting</p>
<p><strong>Security teams are worried:</strong><br />
- "What if someone pastes credentials?"<br />
- "How do we audit this?"<br />
- "What data is leaving our environment?"<br />
- Quietly freaking out, no formal response</p>
<p><strong>Leadership wants metrics:</strong><br />
- "What's the ROI?"<br />
- "Are we getting efficiency gains?"<br />
- "Should we invest more?"<br />
- Nobody can answer with data</p>
<p><strong>Compliance needs documentation:</strong><br />
- "Show the examiner our AI governance"<br />
- "Prove we have controls in place"<br />
- "Document the audit trail"<br />
- Scrambling when asked</p>
<p><strong>So who's responsible for all of this?</strong></p>
<p>IT Operations? They enable tools, don't govern usage.</p>
<p>Security? They block threats, don't optimize efficiency.</p>
<p>Business Intelligence? They measure outcomes, don't understand AI.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: Nobody.</strong></p>
<p>The work is falling between organizational cracks.</p>
<h2>Test This Yourself (Don't Take My Word)</h2>
<p><strong>Experiment 1: Search for these job titles</strong></p>
<p>Go to LinkedIn right now. Search for:<br />
- "AI Operations Governance"<br />
- "AI Security Engineer" + "ChatGPT monitoring"<br />
- "AI Business Analyst" + "operations intelligence"</p>
<p>What you'll find:<br />
- Generic IT operations roles<br />
- Traditional cybersecurity positions<br />
- Data science analyst jobs</p>
<p>What you WON'T find:<br />
- Specific AI governance positions<br />
- Roles monitoring AI tool usage<br />
- Jobs measuring AI operational efficiency</p>
<p>The roles don't exist officially. The work is happening anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 2: Ask your own organization</strong></p>
<p>Ask your security team: "Who's monitoring what people ask ChatGPT about our Azure environment?"</p>
<p>Ask your leadership: "What's the ROI of our AI tool investments?"</p>
<p>Ask your IT operations: "Who trains people on using AI tools correctly?"</p>
<p>Answers are probably:<br />
- "Nobody specifically"<br />
- "We don't have metrics on that"<br />
- "People just figure it out"</p>
<p>That's the gap.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment 3: Check Microsoft's direction</strong></p>
<p>Look at what Microsoft is building:<br />
- GitHub Copilot integration in Azure Portal (already live)<br />
- Copilot for Azure (general availability coming)<br />
- AI-generated scripts in Cloud Shell (preview)<br />
- AI assistants everywhere in the platform</p>
<p>They're not building this for fun.</p>
<p>They're building this because enterprises will adopt it at scale.</p>
<p>And when enterprises adopt something at scale, someone has to govern it.</p>
<h2>Why One "AI Admin" Role Doesn't Work</h2>
<p>Initial assumption: "We need one person who governs AI usage."</p>
<p>That's what I thought too.</p>
<p>Then I mapped out what that person would actually DO every day:</p>
<p><strong>Morning:</strong><br />
- Troubleshoot why Copilot isn't working for three engineers<br />
- Review security alerts about suspicious AI usage<br />
- Build a dashboard showing AI efficiency gains for leadership meeting</p>
<p><strong>Afternoon:</strong><br />
- Train new team on prompt engineering<br />
- Investigate possible credential leakage incident<br />
- Analyze usage patterns to identify knowledge gaps</p>
<p><strong>These are three completely different jobs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Making AI tools work</strong> requires Azure expertise and training skills.</p>
<p><strong>Preventing AI disasters</strong> requires security operations and risk assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring AI value</strong> requires data analysis and business intelligence.</p>
<p>Different skill sets. Different success metrics. Different reporting structures.</p>
<p>Enterprises don't create jobs that report to three different executives and require three unrelated skill sets.</p>
<p>They create three distinct roles.</p>
<h2>Role 1: The AI Admin</h2>
<p><strong>What this person actually does every day:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday morning:</strong><br />
"Hey, why isn't Copilot working in my Azure Portal?"<br />
→ Troubleshoot authentication issues<br />
→ Fix RBAC permissions<br />
→ Document the solution</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday afternoon:</strong><br />
"I need a PowerShell script that creates VMs with our company's tagging standards. Can you help?"<br />
→ Build prompt template that includes compliance requirements<br />
→ Test it generates correct output<br />
→ Add to shared prompt library</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong><br />
"We hired three new engineers. They need to learn AI-augmented workflows."<br />
→ Run training session<br />
→ Demonstrate effective prompting<br />
→ Share best practices</p>
<p><strong>Thursday:</strong><br />
"Everyone keeps asking AI the same ExpressRoute question. Can we make this easier?"<br />
→ Create reusable prompt template<br />
→ Document common patterns<br />
→ Add to knowledge base</p>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong><br />
"The AI generated script broke our naming convention."<br />
→ Fix the prompt template<br />
→ Add validation<br />
→ Update documentation</p>
<p><strong>This is operations work. Making tools work. Training people. Building reusable patterns.</strong></p>

Clear demonstration of value.<br />
Leadership can make informed decisions.<br />
Budget justified or expanded.</p>
<p><strong>Insights delivered:</strong><br />
Actionable recommendations provided.<br />
Knowledge gaps identified.<br />
Training needs documented.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy of recommendations:</strong><br />
Did your suggestions actually work?<br />
Were training needs real?<br />
Was tool expansion justified?</p>
<p><strong>Executive satisfaction:</strong><br />
Are leaders getting the information they need?<br />
Can they make decisions based on your reports?<br />
Are you invited to strategic discussions?</p>
<h3>What This Role Is Called Right Now</h3>
<p><strong>Current placeholder titles:</strong><br />
- "Business Analyst" (tracking AI usage as side project)<br />
- "Operations Intelligence Analyst" (AI metrics added)<br />
- "BI Developer" (dashboards include AI now)</p>
<p><strong>What this becomes:</strong><br />
- "AI Operations Intelligence Analyst"<br />
- "AI Business Intelligence Lead"<br />
- "AI Value Measurement Specialist"</p>
<p><strong>Salary prediction:</strong><br />
$95K-$140K in analytics range.</p>
<p>Similar to business intelligence roles.<br />
Premium for AI specialization.</p>
<p>This role emerges third. After companies adopt AI and security is handled, they want to optimize.</p>
<h2>How Companies Will Actually Staff This</h2>
<p>Reality varies by company size:</p>
<p><strong>Small companies (&lt;500 people):</strong></p>
<p>One person wears all three hats.<br />
Usually falls to IT operations lead.<br />
"You're technical, you figure out this AI stuff."</p>
<p>Works until AI usage scales beyond one person.</p>
<p><strong>Mid-size companies (500-2000):</strong></p>
<p>AI Admin hired first (operations need).<br />
Security engineer adds AI monitoring (risk requirement).<br />
Analyst function shared with existing BI team (metrics request).</p>
<p>Formal coordination meetings start.<br />
Roles still not completely distinct.</p>
<p><strong>Large enterprises (2000+):</strong></p>
<p>All three as distinct positions.<br />
Each with dedicated budget.<br />
Clear reporting structures.<br />
Formal collaboration processes.</p>
<p>AI Admin reports to Infrastructure/Operations.<br />
AI Security Engineer reports to InfoSec.<br />
AI Analyst reports to Business Intelligence or Operations Analytics.</p>
<p>Different organizations. Different metrics. Different priorities.</p>
<p>This is how enterprises work.</p>
<h2>Why These Roles Will Definitely Exist</h2>
<p><strong>Pattern recognition from previous technology shifts:</strong></p>
<h3>VMware Administration (2000-2010)</h3>
<p><strong>Year 2000:</strong><br />
"Physical servers are how real infrastructure works."<br />
"Virtualization is just for dev/test environments."<br />
"We don't need dedicated VMware admins."</p>
<p><strong>Year 2005:</strong><br />
Some companies hiring "virtualization specialists."<br />
Most companies: "The server admin can handle it."</p>
<p><strong>Year 2010:</strong><br />
Every enterprise has dedicated VMware administrators.<br />
Distinct career path.<br />
Formal training and certifications.<br />
Market-rate salaries established.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Physical server admin roles mostly eliminated.</p>
<h3>Cloud Architecture (2010-2020)</h3>
<p><strong>Year 2010:</strong><br />
"Cloud is not for production workloads."<br />
"We need on-premises control."<br />
"We don't need cloud architects."</p>
<p><strong>Year 2015:</strong><br />
Some companies hiring "cloud engineers."<br />
Most companies: "The infrastructure team can handle it."</p>
<p><strong>Year 2020:</strong><br />
Every enterprise has cloud architects.<br />
Distinct specialization.<br />
High demand, established salaries.<br />
Multiple certification paths.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Datacenter operations roles largely eliminated.</p>
<h3>DevOps Engineering (2010-2020)</h3>
<p><strong>Year 2010:</strong><br />
"Developers develop, operations deploys."<br />
"We don't need people who do both."<br />
"DevOps is a philosophy, not a job."</p>
<p><strong>Year 2015:</strong><br />
Some companies hiring "DevOps engineers."<br />
Most companies: "We already have dev and ops teams."</p>
<p><strong>Year 2020:</strong><br />
DevOps engineer is standard role.<br />
Clear responsibilities.<br />
Defined skill sets.<br />
Competitive salaries.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Traditional sysadmin roles transformed.</p>
<h3>AI Operations Governance (2025-2027)</h3>
<p><strong>Year 2025 (now):</strong><br />
"AI is just a tool people use."<br />
"We don't need dedicated AI governance."<br />
"Someone can monitor it as a side project."</p>
<p><strong>Year 2026 (prediction):</strong><br />
Some companies hiring "AI operations" roles.<br />
Most companies: "The ops/security/BI team can handle it."</p>
<p><strong>Year 2027 (prediction):</strong><br />
Every enterprise has AI operations roles.<br />
Three distinct functions.<br />
Formal job descriptions.<br />
Market-rate salaries.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Manual operations roles transform or disappear.</p>
<p><strong>The pattern always plays out the same way:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>New technology emerges</li>
<li>"This won't require new roles"</li>
<li>Early adopters prove otherwise</li>
<li>Mainstream slowly accepts reality</li>
<li>Role formalizes</li>
<li>People who positioned early win</li>
</ol>
<p>We're at step 2 right now.</p>
<h2>What These Roles Actually Look Like Working Together</h2>
<p><strong>Real scenario: AI-generated PowerShell for production deployment</strong></p>
<h3>The Workflow</h3>
<p><strong>Engineer submits request:</strong><br />
"I need PowerShell to deploy 50 VMs across three subscriptions with specific tagging and security requirements."</p>
<p><strong>AI Admin involvement:</strong><br />
→ Uses validated prompt template from library<br />
→ Template includes compliance requirements automatically<br />
→ Generates PowerShell script<br />
→ Initial validation (syntax, logic, standards)<br />
→ Forwards to security review</p>
<p><strong>AI Security Engineer involvement:</strong><br />
→ Reviews AI-generated script<br />
→ Validates against security policies<br />
→ Checks for privilege escalation risks<br />
→ Confirms compliance requirements met<br />
→ Approves with documentation<br />
→ Logs approval in audit trail</p>
<p><strong>AI Analyst involvement:</strong><br />
→ Records time saved (15 minutes vs. 2 hours manual)<br />
→ Tracks this as common pattern<br />
→ Notes prompt template effectiveness<br />
→ Adds to ROI calculation<br />
→ Identifies this as high-value use case</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong><br />
- Script deployed in 20 minutes (vs. 2+ hours manual)<br />
- Security validated and documented<br />
- Compliance requirements met<br />
- Time savings measured<br />
- Best practice captured for future use</p>
<p><strong>Three roles. One workflow. All necessary.</strong></p>
<p>Without AI Admin: No validated prompt template, engineer struggles.<br />
Without AI Security Engineer: Script might violate policies, no audit trail.<br />
Without AI Analyst: No measurement of value, can't justify continued investment.</p>
<p>Each role essential to the process.</p>
<h2>What This Means If You Position Yourself Now</h2>
<p><strong>Current state (November 2025):</strong></p>
<p>Roles don't exist officially.<br />
No certifications or formalized training.<br />
No established salary bands.<br />
No standard job descriptions.</p>
<p>Work is happening anyway.<br />
Falling to whoever seems capable.<br />
Ad-hoc assignments.<br />
No career path.</p>
<p><strong>12-24 months from now (2026-2027):</strong></p>
<p>Roles get formalized.<br />
Job descriptions written.<br />
Salary bands established.<br />
Training and certification emerge.<br />
Career paths defined.</p>
<p><strong>The opportunity:</strong></p>
<p>People who position NOW will:<br />
- Define what the roles become<br />
- Set salary expectations (first hires establish market rate)<br />
- Become the "experts" everyone else learns from<br />
- Get hired before public job postings<br />
- Skip the "entry-level" phase</p>
<p><strong>Historical example: Early Cloud Architects</strong></p>
<p><strong>2012-2014:</strong><br />
People doing cloud architecture work without title.<br />
No formal training programs.<br />
No established career path.</p>
<p>Those people:<br />
- Defined what "cloud architect" meant<br />
- Established market rates ($120K-$180K)<br />
- Became the experts everyone else learned from<br />
- Published books, created courses<br />
- Led practices at consulting firms</p>
<p><strong>2015-2020:</strong><br />
Role formalized.<br />
Training programs emerged.<br />
Certifications created.<br />
Market flooded with candidates.</p>
<p>Early positioners became VPs and Principal Architects.<br />
Later entrants fought for associate positions.</p>
<p><strong>Same pattern will play out with AI operations roles.</strong></p>
<p>First movers set the standard. Latecomers follow it.</p>
<h2>Where to Actually Start</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1: Pick which role fits your current skills</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you're operations-focused:</strong><br />
You probably already troubleshoot tools and train people.<br />
AI Admin is the natural path.</p>
<p>Start:<br />
- Use AI tools for your daily work<br />
- Build prompt templates as you go<br />
- Document what works<br />
- Share with your team (informally)</p>
<p><strong>If you're security-focused:</strong><br />
You already monitor threats and enforce policies.<br />
AI Security Engineer is the natural path.</p>
<p>Start:<br />
- Monitor what your team asks AI<br />
- Flag potential issues you notice<br />
- Build simple validation checklists<br />
- Document policy violations</p>
<p><strong>If you're analytics-focused:</strong><br />
You already work with data and build reports.<br />
AI Analyst is the natural path.</p>
<p>Start:<br />
- Track your own AI usage and time savings<br />
- Build simple dashboards<br />
- Calculate ROI for your team<br />
- Present findings to leadership</p>
<p><strong>Pick the one that fits your current role. Don't try to do all three.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Do the work before the title exists</strong></p>
<p><strong>For AI Admin path:</strong></p>
<p>Week 1-4: Use AI daily<br />
- ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot - whatever works<br />
- Real tasks, not toy examples<br />
- Document what you learn</p>
<p>Week 5-8: Build templates<br />
- Create reusable prompts<br />
- Include your compliance requirements<br />
- Test for accuracy<br />
- Start a shared library</p>
<p>Week 9-12: Train others<br />
- Show teammates how you're using AI<br />
- Share your prompt templates<br />
- Answer questions<br />
- Build internal expertise</p>
<p><strong>For AI Security Engineer path:</strong></p>
<p>Week 1-4: Observe and document<br />
- What are people asking AI?<br />
- Any security concerns?<br />
- Where are the risks?<br />
- Document patterns</p>
<p>Week 5-8: Build checklists<br />
- What should be validated?<br />
- What's high risk vs. low risk?<br />
- Create simple frameworks<br />
- Test with real examples</p>
<p>Week 9-12: Implement monitoring<br />
- Even informal tracking helps<br />
- Log concerning patterns<br />
- Report to security team<br />
- Demonstrate the need</p>
<p><strong>For AI Analyst path:</strong></p>
<p>Week 1-4: Track your usage<br />
- Time saved on tasks<br />
- What AI helps with most<br />
- Where it doesn't help<br />
- Calculate your personal ROI</p>
<p>Week 5-8: Expand to team<br />
- Ask teammates about their usage<br />
- Aggregate the data<br />
- Find patterns<br />
- Calculate team ROI</p>
<p>Week 9-12: Build dashboard<br />
- Visualize the findings<br />
- Show leadership<br />
- Make recommendations<br />
- Demonstrate value</p>
<p><strong>You're not waiting for permission. You're doing the work and documenting results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Document everything publicly</strong></p>
<p>Blog posts about what you're learning.<br />
GitHub repos with tools you're building.<br />
Conference talks or local meetups.</p>
<p>When the role gets formalized, you're the expert who documented the emergence.</p>
<p><strong>What to document:</strong></p>
<p><strong>For AI Admin:</strong><br />
- Prompt templates that work<br />
- Training materials you created<br />
- Common mistakes and solutions<br />
- Best practices you discovered</p>
<p><strong>For AI Security Engineer:</strong><br />
- Security risks you identified<br />
- Validation frameworks you built<br />
- Policy violations you caught<br />
- Monitoring approaches that work</p>
<p><strong>For AI Analyst:</strong><br />
- ROI calculations and methods<br />
- Usage patterns you found<br />
- Insights that drove decisions<br />
- Dashboard designs that work</p>
<p><strong>You're creating the training materials that will be used when these roles formalize.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Position for the formal role</strong></p>
<p>When your company creates the position:<br />
- You've been doing the work for 12+ months<br />
- You have documented results to show<br />
- You have established expertise<br />
- You're the obvious choice</p>
<p>When OTHER companies create the position:<br />
- You have portfolio of work<br />
- You have blog/GitHub presence<br />
- You have demonstrable expertise<br />
- You're the external hire they want</p>
<p><strong>This is your 12-24 month window.</strong></p>
<h2>What I'm Actually Doing About This</h2>
<p>Not making predictions. Running experiments.</p>
<p><strong>This month:</strong><br />
- Using AI for 50+ Azure operations tasks<br />
- Tracking success rate and time savings<br />
- Building validation frameworks<br />
- Documenting what works and what doesn't</p>
<p><strong>Next 3 months:</strong><br />
- Define all three roles in detail (three separate posts coming)<br />
- Build platform that enables these roles<br />
- Test in production environment<br />
- Document results publicly</p>
<p><strong>Next 6-12 months:</strong><br />
- Establish expertise in AI operations governance<br />
- Build tools that others can use<br />
- Create training materials<br />
- Position for formal role emergence</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong><br />
When these roles get formalized, I want to be the person who defined them.</p>
<p>Not because I have it all figured out.</p>
<p>Because I'm documenting the transition in real-time.</p>
<p>Learning publicly. Building tools. Sharing results.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p><strong>These aren't predictions. These are patterns:</strong></p>
<p>AI tools ARE being adopted for operations (verifiable, happening now).<br />
Someone HAS to govern this (work exists, undeniable).<br />
Current roles DON'T fully cover it (organizational gap, clear).<br />
Enterprises WILL formalize these functions (historical pattern, established).</p>
<p><strong>The timeline:</strong></p>
<p>Now: Work falls between organizational cracks.<br />
6 months: Ad-hoc assignments to whoever seems capable.<br />
12 months: Some companies create formal roles.<br />
24 months: Standard job titles across industry.</p>
<p><strong>The opportunity:</strong></p>
<p>Position yourself BEFORE roles are formalized.<br />
Define what the roles become.<br />
Be the expert when companies start hiring.<br />
Skip the "entry level" phase entirely.</p>
<p><strong>The choice:</strong></p>
<p>Wait until roles are official → compete with everyone else.<br />
Position now → define the standard others follow.</p>
<p>First movers set the market. Latecomers follow.</p>

<p><em>Already doing AI operations work without a formal title? Tell me which of these three roles matches what you're actually doing.</em></p>
<p><em>Think this is overblown? Search for these job titles yourself. Then check back in 12 months and see if I was right.</em></p>
<p><em>Questions about positioning for these roles? Drop them below. We're all documenting this transition together.</em></p>
