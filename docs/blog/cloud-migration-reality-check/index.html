Common failures: (1) Discovering application owners don't exist or refuse cloud migration mid-project, (2) Finding vendor contracts require 90-day termination notice after migration planning is complete, (3) Realizing OEM licenses don't transfer to Azure without purchasing new Volume Licenses, (4) Learning applications have undocumented dependencies requiring simultaneous migration, (5) Discovering true operating costs include hidden support contracts not in budgets. Technical assessments are irrelevant if you can't answer 'Who owns this application and will they support it in Azure?' Executive leadership blocks migrations when business questions remain unanswered after months of technical planning."

Azure Migrate estimates Azure consumption but omits support contracts, vendor fees, training, and organizational change costs. (2) What's the financial risk if migration fails or costs exceed estimates? Need risk-adjusted budget ranges, not single-point estimates. (3) When can we exit datacenter contracts and eliminate those costs? Requires vendor contract analysis and termination clause review. (4) What's the opportunity cost of this migration versus other IT initiatives? Requires business impact assessment beyond technical feasibility. (5) How do we validate ongoing Azure costs won't spiral without proper FinOps governance? Requires cost management framework before migration starts. CFOs block migrations when technical assessments don't address financial risk and organizational readiness."

Common hidden dependencies: shared file servers, centralized authentication systems, legacy batch jobs, middleware message queues, and external vendor APIs. Plan minimum 30-day observation period to capture monthly/quarterly processes. Document dependencies in migration wave planning - simultaneous migration of dependent systems reduces failure risk from 40% to 15%."

Average audit penalty: $50K-$200K for mid-sized environments. Complete licensing audit 6+ months before migration with legal review of all vendor agreements."

Azure Migrate excels at: (1) VM inventory and right-sizing recommendations, (2) Performance-based sizing using actual CPU/memory utilization, (3) Azure cost estimates based on current usage patterns, (4) Dependency mapping for application grouping. However, Azure Migrate CANNOT answer: (1) Who owns this application and will they support cloud migration? (2) What vendor contracts must be modified or terminated? (3) What compliance requirements affect cloud deployment? (4) What's the true 3-year TCO including hidden costs? (5) What's the organizational change management plan? Start with the 55-question organizational readiness checklist. If you can't answer questions about ownership, licensing, and vendor relationships, Azure Migrate technical output is premature. Technical assessment without organizational readiness causes 60% of migration failures."

<h2 id="short-answer">Short Answer</h2>
<p>Most organizations waste 3-6 months on Azure Migrate assessments without completing the 55 critical questions that finance and legal will actually block the project over: application ownership, vendor contract status, licensing compliance, disaster recovery commitments, and true operating costs. This framework prevents $50K-$200K disasters before they happen.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-conference-room-reality">The Conference Room Reality</h2>
<p><strong>2019. Leadership announces:</strong> "We're going to the cloud."</p>
<p><strong>Finance asks:</strong> "What will it cost?"<br />
<strong>Leadership:</strong> "Less than what we spend now."</p>
<p><strong>IT asks:</strong> "Which applications are we migrating?"<br />
<strong>Leadership:</strong> "All of them."</p>
<p><strong>Someone asks:</strong> "How many applications do we have?"</p>
<p><strong>Silence.</strong></p>
<p>Nobody knows.</p>
<p><strong>That's the moment this assessment should have appeared.</strong></p>
<p>Not Azure Migrate. Not CAF documentation. Not consultant proposals.</p>
<p>A systematic framework with 55 questions that expose the gaps before you spend millions.</p>
<h3 id="the-80-stall-the-not-my-job-syndrome">The 80% Stall (The 'Not My Job' Syndrome)</h3>
<p>This is why 70% of migrations fail or stall at the 80% mark. You migrate the easy stuff (Lift &amp; Shift), but when you hit the complex legacy apps, everything stops.<br />
Why? Because the "Cloud Team" thinks the "App Team" owns the refactoring, and the "App Team" thinks the "Cloud Team" owns the server.<br />
Without a clear <strong>RACI Matrix</strong>, you will hit a wall of "That's not my job" tickets that burn your budget for months.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-azure-migrations-fail-before-any-workloads-move">Why Azure Migrations Fail (Before Any Workloads Move)</h2>
<p><strong>Azure Migrate discovers servers.</strong> It can't discover:<br />
- ❌ Whether the business owner left the company in 2021<br />
- ❌ Where the installer ISO is stored (or if it exists)<br />
- ❌ If the vendor still exists or supports this version<br />
- ❌ Whether the license allows cloud hosting<br />
- ❌ If anyone actually uses the application</p>
<p><strong>The #1 cause of migration failures isn't technical. It's organizational readiness.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="real-disasters-this-framework-prevents">Real Disasters This Framework Prevents</h2>
<h3 id="disaster-1-30k-licensing-audit">Disaster #1: $30K Licensing Audit</h3>
<p>Migrated application to Azure. Vendor audit 6 months later: "Your license is for physical servers only. Cloud license is $50K/year."<br />
<strong>Cost:</strong> $30K audit penalty + $50K/year ongoing<br />
<strong>Prevented by:</strong> Question #18 (How is it licensed?)</p>
<h3 id="disaster-2-80k-vendor-termination-fees">Disaster #2: $80K Vendor Termination Fees</h3>
<p>Migrated without checking vendor contract. Early termination clause discovered after migration.<br />
<strong>Cost:</strong> $80K in fees<br />
<strong>Prevented by:</strong> Questions #9 + #21 (Vendor contact + contract expiration)</p>
<h3 id="disaster-3-lost-installation-media">Disaster #3: Lost Installation Media</h3>
<p>Application broke in Azure. Needed rebuild. Installer on Bob's laptop. Bob left in 2019.<br />
<strong>Cost:</strong> 3 weeks downtime + $50K emergency consulting<br />
<strong>Prevented by:</strong> Question #17 (Where's the installer stored?)</p>
<h3 id="disaster-4-unknown-owner-52k-annual-waste">Disaster #4: Unknown Owner = $52K Annual Waste</h3>
<p>Application ran in Azure for 2 years @ $2,200/month. Nobody knew who owned it. Nobody validated it worked.<br />
<strong>Cost:</strong> $52,800 wasted spend<br />
<strong>Prevented by:</strong> Question #5 (Who's accountable if this fails?)</p>
<h3 id="disaster-5-compliance-failure-6-month-delay">Disaster #5: Compliance Failure = 6-Month Delay</h3>
<p>Migrated PCI data without proper controls. Failed audit. Had to rebuild with proper isolation.<br />
<strong>Cost:</strong> 6-month project delay + reputation damage<br />
<strong>Prevented by:</strong> Question #34 (Which compliance frameworks apply?)</p>

🚩 <strong>"The vendor might still support it"</strong> → Licensing risk<br />
🚩 <strong>"We'll figure it out after migration"</strong> → Recipe for disaster  </p>
<p><strong>Each red flag adds risk. Three or more = don't migrate yet.</strong></p>

- ✅ Dependency mapping (technical)<br />
- ✅ Cost estimates based on VM sizing</p>
<p><strong>This framework discovers:</strong><br />
- ✅ Business ownership and accountability<br />
- ✅ Vendor relationships and licensing<br />
- ✅ Compliance requirements<br />
- ✅ Installation and recovery capabilities<br />
- ✅ Strategic value and retirement candidates</p>
<p><strong>You need BOTH.</strong></p>
<p>Azure Migrate = technical inventory<br />
This framework = organizational readiness</p>

<h2 id="time-saved-per-application">Time Saved Per Application</h2>

- 3-6 weeks project delays from surprises<br />
- $50K-$200K disaster costs</p>
<p><strong>With this framework:</strong><br />
- 2-4 hours per application (discover problems before migration)<br />
- Zero surprises (all red flags identified upfront)<br />
- $0 disaster costs</p>
<p><strong>ROI: 5-10x time savings + disaster prevention</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p><strong>Before Azure Migrate. Before CAF. Before consultants.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer these 55 questions for every application.</strong></p>
<p>If you can't answer 50% with high confidence, <strong>you're not ready to migrate yet.</strong></p>
<p>That's not failure. <strong>That's clarity.</strong></p>
<p>Discovering you're not ready on Day 1 costs $0.</p>
<p>Discovering you're not ready in Month 18 after spending millions? That's expensive.</p>
<p><strong>This framework is what I wish I'd had in 2019.</strong></p>
<p>You have it now. Use it.</p>
