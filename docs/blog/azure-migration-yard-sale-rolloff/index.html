    <h1>If You're Going to Azure, Better Have a Yard Sale and a Roll-Off Ready</h1>
<p><strong>The Azure Migration Phase Nobody Budgets For</strong></p>
<p>The application rationalization workshop went exactly as expected.</p>
<p>200 applications in the inventory. We mapped them to the 6 R's framework:<br />
- <strong>Rehost:</strong> 120 apps (lift-and-shift to Azure)<br />
- <strong>Replatform:</strong> 40 apps (minor changes for PaaS)<br />
- <strong>Refactor:</strong> 20 apps (re-architect for cloud-native)<br />
- <strong>Repurchase:</strong> 10 apps (move to SaaS)<br />
- <strong>Retain:</strong> 10 apps (keep on-prem for now)<br />
- <strong>Retire:</strong> 100 apps (decommission - no longer needed)</p>
<p>Finance lit up when they saw "Retire."</p>
<p>"We only have to migrate 190 apps instead of 200? That's a 50% reduction in migration work! This is going to save us millions!"</p>
<p>Six months later, Finance called a meeting.</p>
<p>"Why are we still paying for the old data center? I thought we retired those applications."</p>
<p>I pulled up the decommission project tracker.</p>
<p>"We did retire them. Officially. They're just... still running."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because decommissioning 100 retired applications turns out to be a 6-month project that costs over $100,000 and requires someone to coordinate yard sales and rent dumpsters."</p>
<p>Finance stared at me.</p>
<p>"You're joking."</p>
<p>I was not joking.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The 6 R's Framework Everyone Celebrates</h2>
<p>If you're planning an Azure migration, you've heard about the 6 R's (or 7 R's, depending on which consultant you hired):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rehost</strong> - Lift-and-shift to Azure VMs</li>
<li><strong>Replatform</strong> - Minor changes to use PaaS</li>
<li><strong>Refactor</strong> - Re-architect for cloud-native</li>
<li><strong>Rebuild</strong> - Complete redevelopment</li>
<li><strong>Retire</strong> - Decommission apps no longer needed</li>
<li><strong>Retain</strong> - Keep on-prem temporarily</li>
<li><em>(Sometimes)</em> <strong>Repurchase</strong> - Move to SaaS</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Everyone focuses on the first four Rs.</strong> That's where the migration work happens. That's where application teams spend their time. That's where consultants bill hours.</p>
<p><strong>Finance focuses on the "Retire" R.</strong> Because that's where the savings are.</p>
<p>"We identified 100 applications that nobody uses anymore. We can retire them instead of migrating them. Look at all the money we're saving!"</p>
<p><strong>What Finance thinks "Retire" means:</strong><br />
- Stop paying for them ✅<br />
- Instant cost reduction ✅<br />
- No migration work required ✅</p>
<p><strong>What "Retire" actually means:</strong><br />
- Someone has to physically decommission the hardware<br />
- Someone has to verify nobody actually needs them (they lied on the survey)<br />
- Someone has to handle data destruction (compliance requirement)<br />
- Someone has to dispose of the hardware (e-waste regulations)<br />
- Someone has to cancel maintenance contracts (procurement hell)<br />
- Someone has to coordinate all this (6-month project nobody budgeted)</p>
<p><strong>The gap between those two definitions is where your yard sale and roll-off dumpster come in.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>Application Rationalization: The Setup for Disappointment</h2>
<p>During application rationalization, you survey application owners:</p>
<p>"Do you still use this application?"</p>
<p><strong>What they say:</strong><br />
- "No, we haven't used that in years."<br />
- "That's been replaced by the new system."<br />
- "Pretty sure nobody even remembers the password."</p>
<p><strong>What you hear:</strong><br />
Finance: "Retire it! That's 100 fewer applications to migrate!"</p>
<p><strong>What you should hear:</strong><br />
"That application runs on physical servers that are now officially obsolete but still consuming power, taking up rack space, and costing money every month until someone actually decommissions them."</p>
<p><strong>The difference:</strong> The word "Retire" sounds like a decision. In reality, it's the START of a project.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Zombie Infrastructure Period</h2>
<p>Here's what actually happens after you "retire" 100 applications:</p>
<h3>Month 1: Officially Retired</h3>
<ul>
<li>Applications marked as "Retired" in the CMDB</li>
<li>Migration team moves on to actual migration work</li>
<li>Infrastructure team waits for someone to tell them when to power down</li>
<li>Finance expects cost savings to appear</li>
</ul>
<h3>Month 2: The "Just to Be Sure" Phase</h3>
<p>Application owner: "I know we said we don't use it, but let's give it another month. Just to be sure nobody's using it."</p>
<p>Infrastructure team: "Okay, we'll leave them running."</p>
<h3>Month 3: The "We're Busy with Migration" Phase</h3>
<p>Cloud team: "We can't focus on decommissioning right now. We're busy migrating the 190 apps that actually matter."</p>
<p>Infrastructure team: "Makes sense. We'll get to it later."</p>
<h3>Month 4: Finance Notices</h3>
<p>CFO: "Why is our data center bill still the same? I thought we retired 100 applications."</p>
<p>CIO: "Technically we did retire them. They're just... still physically running."</p>
<p>CFO: "..."</p>
<h3>Month 6: The Meeting</h3>
<p>Subject line: "Data Center Decommission Project Kickoff"</p>
<p>Finance: "Wait, this is a PROJECT? Can't we just turn them off?"</p>
<p>You: "That's... not how this works."</p>
<h3>Month 9: Still Running</h3>
<p>The servers are STILL sitting there because:<br />
- Nobody wants to be the one to actually pull the plug<br />
- Nobody budgeted for decommissioning<br />
- Nobody owns the project<br />
- Everyone's busy with the migration</p>
<p><strong>This is zombie infrastructure:</strong> Officially dead, but still consuming resources.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Yard Sale</h2>
<p>Eventually, someone has to deal with the physical hardware.</p>
<p>You call an ITAD (IT Asset Disposition) vendor for a quote.</p>
<p>"What's the resale value of our retired servers?"</p>
<p>They send back a spreadsheet:</p>
<p><strong>Your Hardware:</strong><br />
- Dell PowerEdge R640 servers (5 years old)<br />
- Original purchase price: $8,000 per server<br />
- Quantity: 50 servers<br />
- Total original investment: $400,000</p>
<p><strong>Current Market Value:</strong><br />
- Resale value per server: $150-250<br />
- Total resale value: $7,500-12,500<br />
- <strong>Recovery rate: 2-3% of original purchase price</strong></p>
<p><strong>You just lost 97% of your hardware investment.</strong></p>
<p>But wait, it gets better.</p>
<p>The ITAD vendor continues:<br />
"For servers older than 5 years, we typically charge $50-100 per unit for pickup and disposal after data destruction costs. Net proceeds: Near zero or negative."</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong> Your 5-year-old servers are worth LESS than nothing after you account for:<br />
- Data destruction (required by compliance)<br />
- Transportation and logistics<br />
- Environmental disposal fees<br />
- Vendor service fees</p>
<p><strong>You're not having a yard sale. You're paying people to take your stuff away.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>The Roll-Off (Reality Check)</h2>
<p>"Roll-off" is industry slang for a dumpster on wheels.</p>
<p>When the ITAD vendor arrives, here's what actually happens:</p>
<h3>Data Destruction Requirements</h3>
<p>Every hard drive requires certified destruction:</p>
<p><strong>Per-Drive Costs:</strong><br />
- Physical shredding: $50-100 per drive<br />
- Certificate of destruction: $10-25 per drive<br />
- Compliance documentation: Included (but time-consuming)</p>
<p><strong>Your Math:</strong><br />
- 100 retired applications<br />
- Average 5 servers per app<br />
- Average 4 drives per server<br />
- Total drives: 2,000 drives<br />
- Data destruction cost: $100,000-200,000</p>
<p><strong>That's MORE than the original resale value of all the hardware.</strong></p>
<h3>E-Waste Disposal</h3>
<p>Servers contain hazardous materials:<br />
- Lead (solder, CRT displays)<br />
- Mercury (switches, thermostats)<br />
- Cadmium (batteries)<br />
- Lithium (UPS systems)</p>
<p><strong>You can't just throw them in a dumpster.</strong></p>
<p><strong>E-Waste Disposal Requirements:</strong><br />
- Certified e-waste recycler (R2/e-Stewards certification)<br />
- Hazardous materials handling fees<br />
- Transportation costs<br />
- Certificate of recycling<br />
- Environmental impact reporting (for ESG compliance)</p>
<p><strong>Typical Disposal Costs:</strong><br />
- Small servers: $25-50 per unit<br />
- Large servers: $75-150 per unit<br />
- Networking equipment: $10-30 per unit<br />
- Storage arrays: $200-500 per unit<br />
- UPS systems: $100-300 per unit</p>
<p><strong>Your retired 100 applications probably include:</strong><br />
- 500 servers<br />
- 200 network switches<br />
- 50 storage arrays<br />
- 50 UPS systems</p>
<p><strong>Total disposal cost: $50,000-100,000</strong></p>
<h3>The Actual Roll-Off Day</h3>
<p>The ITAD vendor arrives with:<br />
- A 40-foot roll-off dumpster<br />
- A crew of 6-8 people<br />
- Pallet jacks and forklifts<br />
- Shrink wrap and pallets<br />
- Security escort (because data is still on the drives)</p>
<p>They spend 2-3 days:<br />
- Disconnecting equipment<br />
- Removing from racks<br />
- Palletizing for transportation<br />
- Loading the roll-off<br />
- Documenting serial numbers (chain of custody)</p>
<p><strong>When they leave:</strong><br />
- Your data center has empty racks<br />
- You have a huge bill for disposal<br />
- Finance is shocked at the cost</p>
<p>"We thought RETIRING apps would SAVE money."</p>
<p>It does. Eventually. After you pay for the yard sale nobody came to and the roll-off dumpster full of hardware that's worthless.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why It Takes 6 Months (The Real Timeline)</h2>
<p>Finance thinks: "Just turn them off."</p>
<p>Reality: Multi-phase project with dependencies.</p>
<h3>Phase 1: Verification (Weeks 1-8)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Confirm applications are actually unused (survey owners AGAIN)</li>
<li>Check for hidden dependencies (nobody mentioned during rationalization)</li>
<li>Verify backups exist (compliance requirement)</li>
<li>Document current state (audit trail)</li>
<li>Get executive sign-off (CYA)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this takes 8 weeks:</strong> Because every application owner who said "we don't use it" suddenly remembers a critical process that runs once a quarter.</p>
<h3>Phase 2: Graceful Shutdown (Weeks 9-12)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Schedule maintenance windows</li>
<li>Notify all stakeholders (even if they said they don't use it)</li>
<li>Power down applications in logical order</li>
<li>Monitor for unexpected issues</li>
<li>Keep backups accessible (30-day minimum hold)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this takes 4 weeks:</strong> Because you WILL discover someone was using that "retired" application, and you need time to deal with the fallout.</p>
<h3>Phase 3: Data Retention (Weeks 13-20)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Archive data per compliance policies</li>
<li>Maintain backups (legal hold, retention policies)</li>
<li>Document data location (audit trail)</li>
<li>Wait for legal to confirm no pending litigation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this takes 8 weeks:</strong> Because Legal says "better keep it for 90 days just in case."</p>
<h3>Phase 4: Physical Decommission (Weeks 21-24)</h3>
<ul>
<li>ITAD vendor engagement (get quotes, select vendor)</li>
<li>Schedule decommission (coordinate with data center)</li>
<li>Physical removal (2-3 days of actual work)</li>
<li>Data destruction (certified process)</li>
<li>Certificate of destruction (documentation)</li>
<li>Asset tracking updates (remove from inventory)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this takes 4 weeks:</strong> Because scheduling, vendor coordination, and paperwork take longer than the actual physical work.</p>
<h3>Phase 5: Contract Cleanup (Weeks 24-26)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cancel maintenance contracts (procurement process)</li>
<li>Terminate software licenses (more procurement)</li>
<li>Update asset inventory (IT ops)</li>
<li>Close projects in PMO (documentation)</li>
<li>Final financial reconciliation (Finance wants receipts)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this takes 2+ weeks:</strong> Because canceling contracts is ALWAYS harder than starting them.</p>
<p><strong>Total: 26 weeks = 6 months</strong></p>
<p>And that's assuming nothing goes wrong. Which it will.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Hidden Costs Finance Never Sees</h2>
<p>When Finance celebrates "Retire," they think:</p>
<p><strong>100 apps retired = 100 apps we don't have to migrate = SAVINGS</strong></p>
<p>What they don't calculate:</p>
<h3>Labor Costs (The Biggest Hidden Cost)</h3>
<p><strong>Project Management:</strong><br />
- PM coordinating decommission: 20 hours/week × 26 weeks = 520 hours<br />
- At $100/hour = $52,000</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Team:</strong><br />
- Engineers executing decommission: 10 hours/week × 26 weeks = 260 hours<br />
- At $80/hour = $20,800</p>
<p><strong>Application Teams:</strong><br />
- Verification and sign-offs: 40 hours total across 100 apps<br />
- At $90/hour = $3,600</p>
<p><strong>Compliance/Legal:</strong><br />
- Data retention verification: 40 hours<br />
- At $120/hour = $4,800</p>
<p><strong>Finance/Procurement:</strong><br />
- Contract cancellations: 30 hours<br />
- At $80/hour = $2,400</p>
<p><strong>Total Labor: $83,600</strong></p>
<h3>Service Costs</h3>
<p><strong>Data Destruction:</strong><br />
- 2,000 drives × $75 average = $150,000</p>
<p><strong>Equipment Disposal:</strong><br />
- E-waste handling = $50,000</p>
<p><strong>ITAD Vendor Fees:</strong><br />
- Project management, logistics, documentation = $15,000</p>
<p><strong>Minus Resale Recovery:</strong><br />
- Hardware resale value = -$10,000</p>
<p><strong>Net Service Costs: $205,000</strong></p>
<h3>Ongoing Costs During Decommission</h3>
<p><strong>Data Center Costs (While Waiting):</strong><br />
- Colo space: $2,000/month × 6 months = $12,000<br />
- Power: $1,000/month × 6 months = $6,000</p>
<p><strong>Total Ongoing: $18,000</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>The Grand Total</h2>
<p><strong>Total cost to "retire" 100 applications:</strong><br />
- Labor: $83,600<br />
- Services: $205,000<br />
- Ongoing: $18,000<br />
- <strong>Total: $306,600</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finance thought:</strong> "We're saving money by not migrating these!"</p>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> "We're spending $306K to physically decommission hardware for apps we already decided not to migrate."</p>
<p><strong>The painful truth:</strong> You're not avoiding migration costs. You're trading them for decommission costs.</p>
<p>And nobody budgeted for this.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What Finance Should Actually Budget</h2>
<p>When your application rationalization identifies apps to "Retire," Finance should immediately ask:</p>
<p><strong>"What's the decommission budget?"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Minimum Budget (Per Retired Application):</strong><br />
- $500-1,000 for applications on shared infrastructure<br />
- $2,000-5,000 for applications on dedicated hardware<br />
- $10,000+ for applications with complex compliance requirements</p>
<p><strong>For 100 retired applications, budget $200K-500K for decommissioning.</strong></p>
<p>That's not a typo. That's the real cost of "Retire."</p>
<p><strong>What gets you to the high end:</strong><br />
- Older hardware (worth nothing, costs money to dispose)<br />
- Lots of storage (data destruction is expensive per-drive)<br />
- Compliance requirements (legal holds, retention policies, audit trails)<br />
- Multiple data centers (travel, logistics, coordination)<br />
- Contract complexity (cancellation fees, notice periods)</p>
<p><strong>What gets you to the low end:</strong><br />
- Newer hardware (actual resale value)<br />
- Virtualized (fewer physical assets)<br />
- Simple compliance (no special retention)<br />
- Single location (easier logistics)<br />
- Month-to-month contracts (easy cancellation)</p>
<p><strong>The average enterprise with mixed infrastructure? Plan for $300K.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>The Organizational Problem Nobody Admits</h2>
<p>Here's why decommissioning turns into a 6-month disaster:</p>
<p><strong>Nobody owns it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cloud Migration Team:</strong> "We migrated the apps to Azure. Not our problem."</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Team:</strong> "We'll power them down when someone tells us to."</p>
<p><strong>Application Teams:</strong> "We stopped using those apps. Someone else deal with the hardware."</p>
<p><strong>Facilities:</strong> "We manage the data center space. Not responsible for what's in the racks."</p>
<p><strong>Finance:</strong> "We approved the migration budget. Nobody told us about decommissioning."</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Zombie infrastructure sitting in your data center for months because everybody thinks it's someone else's job.</p>
<p><strong>The fix:</strong> Assign a Decommission Project Manager.</p>
<p>This is a REAL PROJECT with:<br />
- Timeline<br />
- Budget<br />
- Resources<br />
- Stakeholders<br />
- Deliverables</p>
<p>Treat it like one.</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Conversation Finance Needs to Hear</h2>
<p>Next time Finance celebrates the "Retire" R during application rationalization:</p>
<p><strong>Finance:</strong> "We're retiring 100 apps instead of migrating them! That's saving us millions in migration costs!"</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> "Great. What's the decommission budget?"</p>
<p><strong>Finance:</strong> "Decommission budget? We're SAVING money by not migrating them."</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> "Those 100 apps run on physical hardware. That hardware needs to be:<br />
- Verified as actually unused (nobody lied on the survey)<br />
- Gracefully shut down (with rollback plans)<br />
- Data archived or destroyed (compliance)<br />
- Physically removed from racks (labor)<br />
- Data destruction certified (regulations)<br />
- Disposed of properly (e-waste)<br />
- Contracts canceled (procurement)</p>
<p>All of that takes about 6 months and costs $300K+. When do you want to schedule the project kickoff?"</p>
<p><strong>Finance:</strong> "..."</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> "Also, those servers we bought for $400K five years ago? They're worth about $10K now. So we're actually paying disposal fees. Should I get quotes for the roll-off dumpster?"</p>
<p><strong>Finance:</strong> "The WHAT?"</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> "The dumpster. For the servers. They're e-waste. We need a certified disposal vendor. Also, better have a yard sale first, but nobody's going to show up because 5-year-old servers are worthless."</p>
<p><strong>Finance:</strong> "This wasn't in the business case."</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> "No. It never is."</p>
<hr />
<h2>The Yard Sale and Roll-Off Reality</h2>
<p><strong>If you're going to Azure, better have:</strong></p>
<h3>The Yard Sale</h3>
<ul>
<li>ITAD vendor quotes</li>
<li>Hardware inventory (serial numbers, ages, condition)</li>
<li>Realistic expectations (5-year-old servers = 2% of purchase price)</li>
<li>Acceptance that you're not recovering meaningful value</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Roll-Off</h3>
<ul>
<li>E-waste disposal vendor</li>
<li>Data destruction certification</li>
<li>Compliance documentation</li>
<li>Budget for $50-100 per drive for destruction</li>
<li>Dumpster rental (literal dumpster for worthless hardware)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Timeline</h3>
<ul>
<li>6 months minimum for proper decommissioning</li>
<li>Not "just turn them off"</li>
<li>Real project with real costs</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<ul>
<li>$200K-500K for 100 retired applications</li>
<li>Not savings, actual cost</li>
<li>Finance needs to plan for this</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>What Nobody Tells You</h2>
<p><strong>The Azure migration is the easy part.</strong></p>
<p>Rehosting 100 apps? That's lift-and-shift. Cloud team knows how to do that.</p>
<p><strong>The hard part is what comes AFTER:</strong></p>
<p>Decommissioning 100 retired applications means:<br />
- Coordinating physical removal across multiple data centers<br />
- Managing data destruction compliance<br />
- Handling e-waste disposal regulations<br />
- Canceling contracts that nobody remembered we had<br />
- Dealing with zombie infrastructure that nobody wants to be responsible for<br />
- Spending money to dispose of hardware that's worthless</p>
<p><strong>And Finance never budgets for it because the word "Retire" sounds like a decision, not a project.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Application rationalization is great. The 6 R's framework helps you make good decisions about which apps to migrate, modernize, or retire.</p>
<p><strong>But when Finance celebrates the "Retire" R, make sure they understand:</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Retire" doesn't mean:</strong><br />
- Stop paying for it immediately ✅<br />
- Instant cost savings ✅<br />
- No work required ✅</p>
<p><strong>"Retire" means:</strong><br />
- 6-month decommissioning project<br />
- $200K-500K in labor, disposal, and service costs<br />
- Zombie infrastructure running for months while you figure it out<br />
- A yard sale where nobody shows up<br />
- A roll-off dumpster for $400K worth of hardware that's now worth $10K<br />
- Someone has to actually OWN the decommission project</p>
<p><strong>Next time Finance asks about your Azure migration budget, include a line item:</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Decommissioning: $300,000"</strong></p>
<p>When they ask why, tell them:</p>
<p><strong>"Yard sale and roll-off rental. Trust me."</strong></p>
<p>Because if you're going to Azure, you'd better have both ready.</p>
