<p><strong>I spend 60% of my time as an "Azure Administrator" doing work that no Azure certification teaches.</strong></p>
<p>Not infrastructure deployment. Not identity management. Not networking.</p>
<p><strong>Building reports. Writing queries. Creating dashboards. Answering business questions with data.</strong></p>
<p>Yet when I look at Microsoft's Azure certification paths, <strong>this role doesn't exist.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-azure-certification-path-what-exists-today">The Azure Certification Path (What Exists Today)</h2>
<p>Microsoft offers certifications for:</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure &amp; Operations:</strong><br />
- <strong>AZ-104:</strong> Azure Administrator Associate<br />
- <strong>AZ-305:</strong> Azure Solutions Architect Expert<br />
- <strong>AZ-500:</strong> Azure Security Engineer Associate</p>
<p><strong>Development:</strong><br />
- <strong>AZ-204:</strong> Azure Developer Associate<br />
- <strong>AZ-400:</strong> DevOps Engineer Expert</p>
<p><strong>Data &amp; AI:</strong><br />
- <strong>DP-900:</strong> Azure Data Fundamentals<br />
- <strong>DP-203:</strong> Azure Data Engineer Associate<br />
- <strong>AI-102:</strong> Azure AI Engineer Associate<br />
- <strong>PL-300:</strong> Power BI Data Analyst Associate</p>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> None of these certifications cover the role most Azure admins actually perform.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-that-doesn-t-have-a-certification">The Role That Doesn't Have a Certification</h2>
<p><strong>If you're an Azure Administrator in an enterprise, here's what you actually do:</strong></p>
<h3 id="monday-morning-finance-calls">Monday Morning: Finance Calls</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Azure spend is up $47,000 this month. Explain why."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tools I use:</strong><br />
- Azure Workbooks (not covered in any Azure cert)<br />
- KQL queries joining cost data across 44 subscriptions (AZ-104 barely mentions KQL)<br />
- Power BI dashboard showing cost by business unit (not mentioned in AZ-104)</p>
<p><strong>Which certification teaches this?</strong><br />
- AZ-104? Teaches you how to set cost alerts. Doesn't teach you how to build cost reports.<br />
- PL-300 (Power BI)? Teaches Power BI, but doesn't cover Azure-specific data sources like Resource Graph or Cost Management.<br />
- DP-203 (Data Engineer)? Way too advanced. I don't need to build data pipelines. I need to query Azure data.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: None of them.</strong></p>
<h3 id="tuesday-security-compliance-report">Tuesday: Security Compliance Report</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"SOC2 audit needs a report showing all resources without required tags."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tools I use:</strong><br />

- KQL query scanning 31,000 resources (no certification teaches KQL for Resource Graph)<br />
- Azure Workbook displaying compliance status (no certification teaches Workbook design)</p>
<p><strong>Which certification teaches this?</strong><br />
- AZ-104? Mentions Resource Graph exists. Doesn't teach you how to write queries.<br />
- AZ-500 (Security)? Focuses on security configuration, not compliance reporting.<br />
- DP-203 (Data Engineer)? Teaches data engineering, not operational queries.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: None of them.</strong></p>
<h3 id="wednesday-application-performance-dashboard">Wednesday: Application Performance Dashboard</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Build a dashboard showing which VMs we can safely shut down overnight to save costs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tools I use:</strong><br />
- Azure Monitor Logs (AZ-104 teaches basic alerts only)<br />
- KQL queries analyzing 30 days of CPU/memory metrics (not taught)<br />
- Azure Workbook with interactive filters (not taught)<br />
- Azure Advisor recommendations integrated into Workbook (integration not taught)</p>
<p><strong>Which certification teaches this?</strong><br />
- AZ-104? Teaches you how to configure Azure Monitor. Doesn't teach you how to analyze the data.<br />
- AZ-305 (Architect)? Focuses on solution design, not operational reporting.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: None of them.</strong></p>
<h3 id="thursday-executive-dashboard">Thursday: Executive Dashboard</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Leadership wants one dashboard showing everything wrong with our Azure environment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tools I use:</strong><br />
- Power BI connecting to multiple Azure data sources (not covered in any Azure cert)<br />
- KQL queries from Resource Graph, Log Analytics, and Cost Management (not taught together)<br />
- DAX measures for custom calculations (PL-300 teaches this, but not for Azure data)<br />
- Azure AI to generate natural language insights (no cert teaches AI in operational workflows)</p>
<p><strong>Which certification teaches this?</strong><br />
- AZ-104? Doesn't mention Power BI.<br />
- PL-300 (Power BI)? Doesn't cover Azure-specific data sources or KQL.<br />
- AI-102? Focuses on building AI solutions, not using AI for operations.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: None of them.</strong></p>
<h3 id="friday-vulnerability-remediation-report">Friday: Vulnerability Remediation Report</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Security scan found 285 VMs with high-severity vulnerabilities. Which patches fix which issues?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Tools I use:</strong><br />
- Azure Resource Graph to query VM inventory (mentioned in AZ-104, not taught)<br />
- KQL to join vulnerability scan results with Update Manager compliance (not taught)<br />
- Azure Workbook showing patch status by application owner (not taught)<br />
- Azure OpenAI to summarize findings for non-technical leadership (not taught anywhere)</p>
<p><strong>Which certification teaches this?</strong><br />
- AZ-500 (Security)? Teaches security configuration, not vulnerability reporting.<br />
- AZ-104? Mentions Update Manager. Doesn't teach data analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Answer: None of them.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-pattern-infrastructure-configuration-â-operational-reporting">The Pattern: Infrastructure Configuration â‰  Operational Reporting</h2>
<p><strong>Every Azure certification focuses on:</strong><br />
- How to <strong>configure</strong> Azure services<br />
- How to <strong>deploy</strong> infrastructure<br />
- How to <strong>secure</strong> environments<br />
- How to <strong>architect</strong> solutions</p>
<p><strong>None of them focus on:</strong><br />
- How to <strong>query</strong> Azure data at scale<br />
- How to <strong>build</strong> operational dashboards<br />
- How to <strong>create</strong> business reports<br />
- How to <strong>leverage AI</strong> for operational insights</p>
<p><strong>Yet this is what Azure administrators spend most of their time doing.</strong></p>

<h2 id="real-world-impact-of-this-gap">Real-World Impact of This Gap</h2>
<h3 id="for-new-azure-admins">For New Azure Admins</h3>
<p>You pass AZ-104. You get hired. Day 1:</p>
<p><strong>Manager:</strong> "Build a dashboard showing our Azure costs by application."</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> "AZ-104 didn't teach me Power BI, KQL, or how to query cost data."</p>
<p><strong>Manager:</strong> "Figure it out."</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> 3-6 months of trial and error learning tools the certification should have taught.</p>
<h3 id="for-employers">For Employers</h3>
<p><strong>Job posting:</strong> "Azure Administrator - Must have AZ-104 and ability to build operational dashboards and cost reports."</p>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> AZ-104 teaches neither.</p>
<p><strong>Result:</strong> Either hire someone overqualified (data engineer) or accept a learning curve.</p>
<h3 id="for-microsoft">For Microsoft</h3>
<p>Microsoft builds incredible reporting tools:<br />
- Azure Workbooks<br />
- Azure Resource Graph<br />
- Azure Monitor<br />
- Power BI<br />
- Copilot for Azure<br />
- Azure OpenAI</p>
<p>Microsoft certifies Azure professionals who don't know how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>This is a missed opportunity.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-should-change">What Should Change</h2>
<h3 id="option-1-expand-az-104">Option 1: Expand AZ-104</h3>
<p>Add these modules to Azure Administrator Associate:</p>
<p><strong>New Module 1: Operational Reporting</strong><br />
- Azure Workbooks design (10% of exam)<br />
- KQL for Resource Graph and Monitor (15% of exam)<br />
- 3-5 hands-on Workbook labs</p>
<p><strong>New Module 2: Business Intelligence</strong><br />
- Power BI basics for Azure data (5% of exam)<br />
- Connecting to Cost Management and Resource Graph<br />
- 1-2 hands-on dashboard labs</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> This makes AZ-104 too large</p>
<h3 id="option-2-create-new-certification-better">Option 2: Create New Certification (Better)</h3>
<p><strong>AZ-XXX: Azure Operations and Analytics Associate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> AZ-900 or AZ-104</p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> Azure admins who build reports and dashboards</p>
<p><strong>Exam breakdown:</strong><br />
- 25% Azure Workbooks<br />
- 30% KQL for operations<br />
- 25% Power BI integration<br />
- 20% AI in operations</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong><br />
- Focuses on specific skill gap<br />
- Doesn't bloat existing certs<br />
- Creates career path for reporting-focused admins</p>
<h3 id="option-3-enhance-existing-certs">Option 3: Enhance Existing Certs</h3>
<p><strong>PL-300 (Power BI):</strong><br />
- Add Azure Resource Graph module<br />
- Add Azure Cost Management connector<br />
- Add Azure-specific dashboard examples</p>
<p><strong>AZ-104 (Azure Admin):</strong><br />
- Double KQL coverage<br />
- Add 2-3 Workbook labs<br />
- Mention Power BI exists</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Still fragmented across multiple certs</p>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p><strong>Microsoft has certifications for:</strong><br />
- Building infrastructure (AZ-104)<br />
- Designing solutions (AZ-305)<br />
- Securing environments (AZ-500)<br />
- Building AI (AI-102)<br />
- Analyzing data (DP-203)<br />
- Creating BI reports (PL-300)</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft has NO certification for:</strong><br />
- Building operational dashboards with Workbooks<br />
- Writing KQL queries for Azure operations<br />
- Creating Power BI reports from Azure data<br />
- Using AI for administrative workflows</p>
<p><strong>Yet this is what most Azure administrators actually do 60-80% of the time.</strong></p>
<p>The role exists. The tools exist. The job postings exist.</p>
<p><strong>Only the certification is missing.</strong></p>
