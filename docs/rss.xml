      <title>How I Reverse-Engineered a Power BI Dashboard (PBIX Modernizer Tool)</title>
      <description>Chris Bowman's CCO Dashboard is 200+ pages of Power BI. I needed to understand it to build CCO 2.0. Built a tool that extracts all queries, measures, and relationships in seconds. .pbix files are just ZIP archives.</description>

      <title>The Azure Console Button Is a Lie (And You Don't Need AMA)</title>
      <description>VMware admins: That 'Connect' button isn't console access. Serial Console is hidden in Help > Boot Diagnostics, works without networking, and doesn't require Azure Monitor Agent. Here's what Microsoft didn't tell you.</description>

      <description>Three Microsoft reps gave me three different answers about patching Azure VMs. Here's what each tool actually does, which workloads need which tool, and why you need multiple tools during enterprise migration. The decision matrix Microsoft won't publish.</description>
