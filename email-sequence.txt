**Quick tip:** The KQL queries are designed to work on day one - even if you're managing thousands of resources across multiple subscriptions. Start with Query #1 (VM inventory) and work your way down.

Questions? Just hit reply. I actually read these.

EMAIL #2: DAY 2 - VALUE TEASER
Subject: The one KQL query I use every single day
Send: 2 days after signup
-------------------------------------------

Quick question:

How long does it take you to answer this: "Show me all our VMs with their IPs, sizes, and which ones are running right now"?

If you're like most Azure admins: 15-30 minutes.

You log into Resource Graph Explorer. Write a query. Join to NICs. Extract IPs. Add power state. Debug the syntax errors. Try again.

**Here's the query that does all of it:**

```kql
Resources
| where type == "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines"
| extend powerState = tostring(properties.extended.instanceView.powerState.displayStatus)
| join kind=leftouter (
    Resources
    | where type == "microsoft.network/networkinterfaces"
    | mv-expand ipconfig = properties.ipConfigurations
    | project nicId = id, privateIP = tostring(ipconfig.properties.privateIPAddress)
) on $left.properties.networkProfile.networkInterfaces[0].id == $right.nicId
| project name, resourceGroup, location, vmSize = tostring(properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize), 
  powerState, privateIP
| where powerState contains "running"
```

**This is from the Complete KQL Query Library.**

It has 48 queries like this. All copy-paste ready. All tested on 30,000+ resources.

Cost: $19 (one-time, instant download)

Or keep writing queries from scratch. Your call.

David

P.S. The library includes joins for subnets, disks, subscriptions, and tags. Everything you actually need in production.
