  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>I'm an Azure Architect who got tired of finding tutorials that work perfectly in demos but break in production.</p>

  <p>This blog exists because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft's docs assume your environment is pristine</li>
    <li>Azure Update Manager says you have 1,791 VMs to patch (you don't)</li>
    <li>Fresh marketplace images ship with broken package managers</li>
    <li>Cost reports look nothing like your actual spending</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I write about Azure problems that aren't supposed to happen but do. The posts include working KQL queries, automation scripts you can actually use, and honest assessments of what works and what doesn't.</p>

  <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
  
  <p><strong>KQL &amp; Resource Graph</strong> - Queries that handle real-world messiness, not just demo data</p>
  
  <p><strong>Azure Cost Management</strong> - Why your finance team can't figure out chargeback (and what to do about it)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Automation &amp; Infrastructure</strong> - Scripts tested on actual Azure subscriptions, not clean lab environments</p>
  
  <p><strong>Enterprise Reality</strong> - The gap between Azure's marketing and what happens when you have 2,000 VMs and 300 subscriptions</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  
  <p>Years of Azure architecture work across enterprise environments. I've debugged enough certificate validation errors, cost allocation nightmares, and migration failures to know that most "best practices" need translation before they work in production.</p>

  <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
  
  <p>Found something useful? Have a better approach? Spot an error? <a href="https://github.com/dswann101164">Open an issue on GitHub</a> or connect on LinkedIn.</p>
  
  <p>The goal is simple: fewer hours debugging, more solutions that actually work.</p>
