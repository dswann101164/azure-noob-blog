  <h1>About</h1>
  
  <p>I'm an Azure Architect who got tired of finding tutorials that work perfectly in demos but break in production.</p>

  <p>This blog exists because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Microsoft's docs assume your environment is pristine</li>
    <li>Azure Update Manager says you have 1,791 VMs to patch (you don't)</li>
    <li>Fresh marketplace images ship with broken package managers</li>
    <li>Cost reports look nothing like your actual spending</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I write about Azure problems that aren't supposed to happen but do. The posts include working KQL queries, automation scripts you can actually use, and honest assessments of what works and what doesn't.</p>

  <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
  
  <p><strong>KQL &amp; Resource Graph</strong> - Queries that handle real-world messiness, not just demo data</p>
  
  <p><strong>Azure Cost Management</strong> - Why your finance team can't figure out chargeback (and what to do about it)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Automation &amp; Infrastructure</strong> - Scripts tested on actual Azure subscriptions, not clean lab environments</p>
  
  <p><strong>Enterprise Reality</strong> - The gap between Azure's marketing and what happens when you have 2,000 VMs and 300 subscriptions</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  
  <p>Azure Architect at a $122 billion enterprise, currently managing 44 Azure subscriptions across 300+ applications. I've spent years debugging certificate validation errors, cost allocation nightmares, and migration failures across enterprise environments.</p>
  
  <p>Right now I'm leading a subscription consolidation project through a Q1 2026 merger - combining 44 subscriptions and 21 Active Directory domains. It's the kind of messy, real-world work that never makes it into Microsoft's case studies.</p>
  
  <p>Beyond Azure infrastructure, I build tools that solve actual problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Azure AI integration</strong> - Practical automation using Azure OpenAI for operational tasks</li>
    <li><strong>Power BI modernization</strong> - Converting outdated workbooks into maintainable reporting</li>
    <li><strong>KQL query libraries</strong> - Production-tested Resource Graph queries that handle enterprise scale</li>
    <li><strong>IPAM tools</strong> - IP address management for subscription consolidation projects</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The goal is simple: fewer hours debugging, more solutions that actually work.</p>
