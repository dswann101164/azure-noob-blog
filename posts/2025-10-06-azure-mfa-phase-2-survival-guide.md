## Prerequisites

Before running any queries or scripts:

- **Activity Log ‚Üí Log Analytics**: Enable an Activity Log *diagnostic setting* to send to your Log Analytics workspace (for `AzureActivity`).  
- **Entra Sign-in Logs ‚Üí Log Analytics**: Turn on export for **SigninLogs**, **AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs**, and **NonInteractiveUserSignInLogs**.  
- **Modules / CLI**: Install `Az` and `Microsoft.Graph` modules. Keep Azure CLI updated to at least v2.62+.  

---

## What changed ‚Äî and why you suddenly can‚Äôt deploy

Microsoft‚Äôs **MFA Phase 2** enforcement isn‚Äôt about your sign-in experience ‚Äî it‚Äôs about protecting the **Azure control plane**.  
Beginning **October 2025**, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) operations require MFA compliance, even for automation identities that never logged in interactively.

That means:

- Service principals and managed identities used in pipelines may be blocked.  
- Non-compliant accounts get 401/403 errors when running PowerShell or Azure CLI.  
- Conditional Access policies that once covered only the portal now extend to ARM API calls.  

**In short:** if it can change a resource, it now needs stronger authentication.

---

## Step 1 ‚Äì Identify what‚Äôs failing

Start by checking **Activity Log** for ARM auth failures and **Entra sign-in logs** for Conditional Access blocks.

### Option A ‚Äî Log Analytics (recommended)
```kql
// AzureActivity (requires Activity Log export)
AzureActivity
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Failure"
| where StatusCode in ("401","403") or ActivitySubstatusValue has_any ("AuthorizationFailed","ClientAuthenticationError")
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, OperationNameValue, ActivityStatusValue, ActivitySubstatusValue, StatusCode, CorrelationId, ResourceGroup, SubscriptionId
| sort by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Option B ‚Äî Azure CLI (quick triage)
```bash
az monitor activity-log list   --status Failed --max-events 100   --query "[?contains(status.value,'Failed') && (contains(properties.statusCode,'401') || contains(properties.statusCode,'403') || contains(properties.subStatus,'AuthorizationFailed'))].{time:eventTimestamp,caller:caller,op:operationName.value,code:properties.statusCode}" -o table
```

### Option C ‚Äî PowerShell
```powershell
Get-AzActivityLog -Status Failed -MaxRecord 200 |
  Where-Object { $_.Properties.StatusCode -in @('401','403') -or $_.SubStatus -like '*AuthorizationFailed*' } |
  Select-Object EventTimestamp, Caller, OperationName, ResourceGroupName, Status, @{n='StatusCode';e={$_.Properties.StatusCode}}, SubStatus |
  Sort-Object EventTimestamp -Descending
```

> üí° **Resource Graph ‚â† Log Analytics**  
> Resource Graph shows *what exists now*.  
> Log Analytics shows *what happened*.  
> Authentication and policy failures always live in Log Analytics.

---

## Step 2 ‚Äì Audit your non-interactive accounts

List service principals and managed identities:

```powershell
Get-MgServicePrincipal -All | Select DisplayName, AppId, AccountEnabled, Tags
```

Focus on accounts used by:
- Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions pipelines  
- Terraform or ARM deployments  
- Automation Runbooks  

If any authenticate with *user credentials* instead of a proper identity, they‚Äôll fail Phase 2 enforcement.

---

## Step 3 ‚Äì Fix it the right way

1. **Convert scripts and pipelines** to use **Managed Identity** or **Federated Credentials** instead of secrets.  
2. **Assign roles with least privilege** ‚Äî preferably at the resource-group or workload scope.  
3. **Review Conditional Access policies** that ‚ÄúRequire MFA.‚Äù Exclude automation identities via security groups, not blanket exceptions.  
4. **Validate deployments** before production:

```bash
az deployment group validate   --resource-group rg-test   --template-file main.bicep
```

If validation succeeds, your identity type satisfies MFA.

---

## Step 3a ‚Äì Terraform Pipeline Alignment

Terraform relies on AzureRM provider authentication ‚Äî MFA Phase 2 directly impacts this.

| Auth Method | What It Uses | Impact | Fix |
|--------------|--------------|--------|-----|
| **Service Principal (Secret)** | Static credentials | ‚ùå Non-compliant; often blocked | Switch to **Federated Credential** or **Managed Identity** |
| **Service Principal (Cert)** | X.509 cert | ‚ö†Ô∏è May still fail | Move to Federated Cred |
| **Managed Identity** | VM / pipeline identity | ‚úÖ Compliant | Recommended |
| **OIDC Federated Credential** | Token exchange (GitHub/DevOps) | ‚úÖ MFA-safe, passwordless | Best practice |

**Example ‚Äî Create Federated Credential**
```bash
az ad app federated-credential create   --id <appId>   --parameters '{
    "name": "github-terraform",
    "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
    "subject": "repo:azure-noob/infrastructure:ref:refs/heads/main",
    "audiences": ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
  }'
```

**Terraform Provider Example**
```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  use_oidc = true
}
```

**GitHub Actions**
```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Azure login (OIDC)
        uses: azure/login@v2
        with:
          client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
          tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
          subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
```

‚úÖ This satisfies MFA enforcement because the federated token already passed Azure‚Äôs MFA checks ‚Äî no prompt, no stored secret.

---

## Step 4 ‚Äì Add visibility for ongoing compliance

Track non-MFA compliant callers:

```kql
AuditLogs
| where Category == "Authentication"
| where ConditionalAccessStatus != "satisfied"
| summarize Attempts=count() by UserPrincipalName
```

Embed it in a Workbook.  
Tag automation identities that are MFA-exempt and review quarterly.

---

## Step 5 ‚Äì Educate and document

Phase 2 caught many orgs off-guard because it‚Äôs an **API-layer enforcement**, not a UX change.  
Document:

- Owners of each automation identity  
- Exclusion expirations  
- How new pipelines must authenticate  

A simple wiki table saves hours of failed deploys.

---

## TL;DR ‚Äì Survival Checklist

‚úÖ Identify failed deployments & MFA-blocked accounts  
‚úÖ Move to Managed Identity / Federated Credentials  
‚úÖ Remove wildcard RBAC roles  
‚úÖ Monitor non-MFA logins via Workbook  
‚úÖ Track ownership & renewal dates  

---

## FinOps Note ‚Äì Cost of Broken Automation

Every failed pipeline can quietly raise spend:

- Missed VM deallocations  
- Re-tried deployments  
- Extra log ingestion  

Tie failures to cost data:

```kql
AzureActivity
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Failure"
| summarize FailCount=count() by Caller, bin(TimeGenerated,1d)
| join kind=leftouter (
    Usage
    | summarize DailyCost=sum(PreTaxCost) by Caller, UsageDate=bin(UsageDate,1d)
) on $left.Caller == $right.Caller
| project Caller, FailCount, DailyCost
```

Even security baselines have FinOps impact.
