## Get Started Now

### Step 1: Download the Assets

- [KQL Query Library (PDF)](https://azure-noob.com/static/downloads/kql-query-library.pdf)
- [50 Windows Commands (Web Guide)](/blog/50-windows-commands-azure/)

### Step 2: Start with KQL

If you're new to Azure operations, **start with the KQL Query Library**. These queries help you:

- Understand what's running in your subscriptions
- Identify cost optimization opportunities
- Audit security and compliance
- Monitor performance and health

### Step 3: Bookmark the Command Guides

Keep the Windows and Linux command guides bookmarked. When you run into issues at 3 AM:

- Domain join failures
- Group Policy not applying
- Network connectivity problems
- Disk operations

You'll have the exact commands you need.

### Step 4: Share with Your Team

Use the RACI template to document roles and responsibilities. Clear ownership prevents:

- Duplicate work
- Missed tasks
- Confusion during incidents
- Unclear escalation paths
