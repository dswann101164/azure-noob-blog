**If you're using Azure Bastion, stop what you're doing and read this.**


This guide is part of our [Azure Governance hub](/hub/governance/) covering policy enforcement, compliance frameworks, and enterprise controls.

Microsoft disclosed CVE-2025-49752 on November 20, 2025. It's a **CVSS 10.0** authentication bypass vulnerability in Azure Bastion that allows remote attackers to escalate privileges to admin level **without any credentials**.

This isn't theoretical. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, requires no user interaction, and gives attackers administrative access to every VM connected through your Bastion host.

Here's what you need to know and do right now.

## What Is CVE-2025-49752?

**CVE-2025-49752** is an authentication bypass vulnerability in Azure Bastion classified as CWE-294 (Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay).

**The attack:**
1. Attacker intercepts valid authentication tokens or session credentials
2. Replays those tokens to Azure Bastion
3. Gains administrative access to all VMs accessible through the Bastion host
4. No authentication required, no user interaction needed

**CVSS Score: 10.0** (Critical - Maximum severity)

**Attack Vector:**
- Network-accessible from anywhere
- No prior authentication required
- No special privileges needed
- No user interaction required
- Remote exploitation

**Impact:**
- Complete compromise of all VMs behind the affected Bastion
- Administrative privilege escalation
- Potential lateral movement across your Azure environment

## Why This Is Worse Than It Sounds

Azure Bastion is your **secure** remote access gateway. Organizations use it specifically to:
- Avoid exposing RDP/SSH ports to the internet
- Provide controlled, audited access to VMs
- Implement zero-trust network access

**When Bastion is compromised, your entire security model breaks.**

If an attacker bypasses Bastion authentication:
- They have admin access to every VM you protected with Bastion
- Your audit logs show "legitimate" Bastion sessions
- Network security groups that block direct RDP/SSH are useless
- You thought you were secure - but the front door was wide open

**Real-world scenario:**
- Production VMs: 50 servers behind Azure Bastion
- Attack surface: One authentication bypass
- Blast radius: All 50 servers fully compromised
- Detection difficulty: High (looks like normal Bastion traffic)

This is the **third** critical Azure privilege escalation vulnerability in 2025:
1. CVE-2025-54914 (Azure Networking, CVSS 10.0)
2. CVE-2025-29827 (Azure Automation, CVSS 9.9)
3. CVE-2025-49752 (Azure Bastion, CVSS 10.0)

**Pattern:** Authentication and privilege escalation flaws in core Azure services.

## What Azure Admins Need to Do Immediately

### 1. Verify Your Bastion Instances Are Patched

Microsoft released patches on **November 20, 2025**. Azure Bastion is a managed service, but you need to verify the patch was applied.

**Check patch status:**

```powershell
# List all Azure Bastion instances
Get-AzBastion | Select-Object Name, ResourceGroupName, ProvisioningState, Location

# Check specific Bastion version/status
Get-AzBastion -Name "YourBastionName" -ResourceGroupName "YourRG" | 
  Select-Object Name, ProvisioningState, Sku
```

**What to look for:**
- `ProvisioningState` should be `Succeeded`
- If status shows `Updating`, the patch is being applied
- If status shows `Failed`, contact Azure support immediately

**Managed service caveat:** Azure Bastion patches are typically auto-applied, but **don't assume**. Verify explicitly.

### 2. Audit Recent Bastion Access Logs

Check for suspicious activity **before** the patch was applied.

**Query Azure Activity Logs:**

```kusto
AzureActivity
| where ResourceProvider == "Microsoft.Network"
| where ResourceType == "bastionHosts"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
| where OperationNameValue contains "Microsoft.Network/bastionHosts"
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, OperationNameValue, ActivityStatusValue, 
          ResourceId, Properties
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

**Look for:**
- Unusual authentication attempts
- Access from unexpected IP addresses
- Admin-level operations during off-hours
- Multiple failed auth attempts followed by success (token replay pattern)

**Query Bastion diagnostic logs (if enabled):**

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "BASTIONHOSTS"
| where Category == "BastionAuditLogs"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
| project TimeGenerated, UserName, Protocol, SourceIPAddress, TargetVMName, 
          OperationName, ResultType
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

**Red flags:**
- Same username connecting from different IPs within short timeframes
- Connections to VMs the user doesn't normally access
- Failed connections immediately followed by successful ones
- Authentication from geographic locations that don't match your organization

### 3. Enable Enhanced Logging (If Not Already)

If you don't have Bastion diagnostic logging enabled, **enable it now**.

**Enable diagnostic logging:**

```powershell
# Enable Bastion diagnostics to Log Analytics
$bastion = Get-AzBastion -Name "YourBastionName" -ResourceGroupName "YourRG"
$workspace = Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -Name "YourWorkspace" -ResourceGroupName "YourRG"

Set-AzDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId $bastion.Id -Name "BastionLogs" `
  -WorkspaceId $workspace.ResourceId `
  -Enabled $true `
  -Category "BastionAuditLogs"
```

**What logs to capture:**
- BastionAuditLogs (all connection attempts)
- AzureActivity (infrastructure changes)
- Resource Health (service status)

**Retention:** Set to at least 90 days for compliance and forensic analysis.

### 4. Implement Additional Network Segmentation

While you're patching, add defense-in-depth controls:

**Network Security Group (NSG) hardening:**

```powershell
# Get VMs connected through Bastion
$vms = Get-AzVM | Where-Object {
    $_.NetworkProfile.NetworkInterfaces | 
    ForEach-Object { $nic = Get-AzNetworkInterface -ResourceId $_.Id; 
                     $nic.IpConfigurations.Subnet.Id -match "BastionSubnet" }
}

# Apply restrictive NSG rules
# (Example: Limit Bastion subnet to only known management IPs)
$nsg = Get-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -Name "Bastion-NSG" -ResourceGroupName "YourRG"

# Add rule restricting inbound traffic
$nsg | Add-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig `
  -Name "Restrict-Bastion-Management" `
  -Priority 100 `
  -Direction Inbound `
  -Access Allow `
  -Protocol Tcp `
  -SourceAddressPrefix "YourManagementIPRange" `
  -SourcePortRange "*" `
  -DestinationAddressPrefix "*" `
  -DestinationPortRange "443,3389,22" | 
Set-AzNetworkSecurityGroup
```

**Firewall rules:**
- Limit Bastion subnet outbound access to only necessary VM subnets
- Block internet egress from Bastion subnet (shouldn't need it)
- Enable Azure Firewall for additional traffic inspection

### 5. Review and Restrict Bastion RBAC Permissions

Audit who has access to create/modify Bastion resources:

```kusto
AzureActivity
| where Authorization contains "Microsoft.Network/bastionHosts"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(90d)
| summarize Count = count() by Caller, OperationNameValue, ActivityStatusValue
| order by Count desc
```

**Principle of least privilege:**
- Only network admins should have `Microsoft.Network/bastionHosts/write`
- Use Azure PIM for just-in-time admin access
- Remove standing admin permissions

### 6. Set Up Alerts for Bastion Anomalies

Create alerts to detect potential exploitation attempts:

**Alert on unusual Bastion access patterns:**

```kusto
let NormalUsers = dynamic(["admin@company.com", "netadmin@company.com"]);
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceType == "BASTIONHOSTS"
| where UserName !in (NormalUsers)
| where Protocol in ("ssh", "rdp")
| summarize ConnectionCount = count() by UserName, SourceIPAddress, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| where ConnectionCount > 5  // Threshold
| project TimeGenerated, UserName, SourceIPAddress, ConnectionCount
```

**Alert on Bastion infrastructure changes:**

```kusto
AzureActivity
| where ResourceProvider == "Microsoft.Network"
| where ResourceType == "bastionHosts"
| where OperationNameValue in (
    "Microsoft.Network/bastionHosts/write",
    "Microsoft.Network/bastionHosts/delete"
  )
| where Caller !in ("known-admin@company.com")
| project TimeGenerated, Caller, OperationNameValue, ResourceId, CorrelationId
```

## Technical Details: How the Attack Works

**CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay**

The vulnerability allows an attacker to:
1. **Capture:** Intercept valid Bastion authentication tokens during a legitimate session
2. **Replay:** Send the captured token back to Bastion
3. **Escalate:** Bastion accepts the replayed token and grants admin-level access

**Why it works:**
- Bastion doesn't properly validate token freshness
- No nonce or timestamp verification on authentication tokens
- Replay protection mechanisms are missing or bypassable

**Attack requirements:**
- Network access to Azure Bastion endpoint (internet-accessible by design)
- Ability to capture a single valid token (MITM, network sniffing, compromised endpoint)
- No credentials, no user interaction, no special privileges

**This is why the CVSS is 10.0.** The attack surface is enormous and exploitation is trivial.

## What Microsoft Should Have Done (And Didn't)

Azure Bastion is a **managed service**. Microsoft controls:
- The authentication mechanisms
- Token validation logic
- Session management
- Patching and updates

**This vulnerability shouldn't exist.**

Authentication replay attacks are **well-known**. The mitigations are **well-documented**:
- Token nonces (one-time use)
- Timestamp validation (tokens expire)
- Mutual authentication (verify both client and server)
- Token binding (tie tokens to TLS sessions)

**None of these were properly implemented.**

This is the third CVSS 10.0 vulnerability in Azure services in 2025. All three involve authentication or privilege escalation flaws in managed services that Microsoft fully controls.

**Pattern recognition:** Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative isn't preventing critical authentication bugs in production Azure services.

## What Happens If You Were Compromised?

If an attacker exploited CVE-2025-49752 before you patched:

**Assume breach:**
1. All VMs accessible through the compromised Bastion are potentially compromised
2. Attacker had admin-level access (full control)
3. Lateral movement to other Azure resources is likely

**Incident response steps:**

1. **Isolate affected VMs**
   - Snapshot VMs for forensics
   - Disconnect from network (don't delete - preserve evidence)

2. **Rotate all credentials**
   - Change VM administrator passwords
   - Rotate service principal secrets
   - Regenerate SSH keys
   - Revoke and reissue certificates

3. **Hunt for persistence mechanisms**
   - Check for backdoor accounts
   - Review scheduled tasks / cron jobs
   - Audit firewall rule changes
   - Check for unauthorized software installations

4. **Review audit logs across Azure**
   - Azure Activity Logs (infrastructure changes)
   - Azure AD Sign-in Logs (identity compromise)
   - NSG Flow Logs (network traffic patterns)
   - Storage access logs (data exfiltration)

5. **Engage incident response**
   - If you have sensitive data, assume exfiltration
   - Notify compliance/legal teams
   - Consider third-party forensics

## The Bigger Picture: Azure Security in 2025

**Three critical (CVSS 10.0) authentication bugs in one year suggests systemic issues:**

1. **Authentication logic isn't being threat-modeled properly**
2. **Code reviews aren't catching replay vulnerabilities**
3. **Security testing isn't covering token validation edge cases**

**For Azure administrators:**
- Assume Microsoft's managed services have vulnerabilities
- Implement defense-in-depth (don't rely on single control points)
- Monitor everything (logs, metrics, anomalies)
- Patch immediately when Microsoft releases updates
- Use Azure Defender/Sentinel for threat detection

**Azure Bastion was supposed to be the secure option.** Turns out, it had a CVSS 10.0 auth bypass the whole time.
