## 🧭 Introduction

The **OSI model** (Open Systems Interconnection) is still one of the best mental maps for troubleshooting networks — even in the cloud.

In Azure, every issue — from a VM that won’t ping to an App Service failing to load — lives somewhere on those **seven layers**.  
If you can pinpoint the layer, you can pinpoint the problem.

This guide maps Azure’s IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS services directly to the OSI model and shows how to use that structure to troubleshoot modern cloud environments.

---

## 🔷 Layer 1 — Physical: The Azure Fabric

**Concept:** Hardware, cabling, physical connectivity  
**Azure Reality:** The physical hosts, SDN fabric, and storage managed by Microsoft

**Services:**
- Virtual Machines (compute hosts)
- Managed Disks
- App Service Plan compute (abstracted)
- Azure Stack Hub (on-prem hybrid)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Check **Azure Service Health** for regional outages  
- Check **Resource Health** on VMs or disks  
- Review **Maintenance events** or **host reallocation logs**

---

## 🔷 Layer 2 — Data Link: Virtual Network Isolation

**Concept:** MAC addressing, switching, local delivery  
**Azure Reality:** VNets, subnets, NSGs, and Private Endpoints form layer-2 boundaries

**Services:**
- VNets / Subnets  
- Network Interfaces (NICs)  
- NSGs  
- Private Endpoints & Service Endpoints  
- App Service Environment (ASE)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Use **Network Watcher → IP Flow Verify**  
- Check **Effective Security Rules** for NSGs  
- Validate **Private Endpoint DNS** mapping and status

---

## 🔷 Layer 3 — Network: Routing & Addressing

**Concept:** IP routing and path selection  
**Azure Reality:** Virtual routers and firewalls manage IP movement between VNets and regions

**Services:**
- Route Tables (UDRs)  
- VNet Peering  
- VPN Gateway / Virtual WAN / ExpressRoute  
- Azure Firewall  
- Azure DNS  
- Storage Accounts (via Service/Private Endpoints)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Review **Effective Routes** on VM NICs  
- Use **Network Watcher → Next Hop**  
- Check for overlapping IP spaces or missing routes  
- Validate DNS resolution for storage or service endpoints

---

## 🔷 Layer 4 — Transport: Ports & Load Balancing

**Concept:** TCP/UDP sessions and port control  
**Azure Reality:** Load balancers, firewalls, and NSGs enforce connectivity at this layer

**Services:**
- Azure Load Balancer (L4)  
- Azure Firewall  
- NSGs  
- Storage Accounts (TCP 443 HTTPS / 445 SMB)  
- App Service inbound ports (80/443)  
- AKS node networking  

**Troubleshooting:**
- Run `Test-NetConnection <fqdn> -Port 443`  
- Verify **NSG Flow Logs**  
- Check **Load Balancer health probes**  
- Confirm firewall and NVA NAT rules  

---

## 🔷 Layer 5 — Session: Identity & Persistence

**Concept:** Establishing and maintaining sessions  
**Azure Reality:** Authentication, tokens, and session lifetimes managed by Entra ID or SAS tokens

**Services:**
- Azure Bastion / Jumpboxes (RDP, SSH)  
- Entra ID (Azure AD)  
- App Service / Functions with AD authentication  
- Storage Accounts (SAS, RBAC)  
- SQL / Cosmos DB (token or connection string auth)  
- API Management (session affinity)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Review **Sign-in logs** in Entra ID  
- Check token expiry or refresh failures  
- Validate **RBAC or SAS permissions**  
- Ensure **sticky sessions** are configured if required  

---

## 🔷 Layer 6 — Presentation: Encryption & Format

**Concept:** Data encryption, serialization, translation  
**Azure Reality:** TLS, Key Vault, and encryption at rest or in transit  

**Services:**
- Azure Key Vault (certificates, secrets)  
- Application Gateway / Front Door (TLS offload)  
- Storage (SSE, CMK)  
- SQL Database (TDE)  
- API Management (policy transforms)  
- Functions / Web Apps (HTTPS endpoints)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Check **TLS version** and **SSL certificate expiry**  
- Validate **Key Vault access policies**  
- Review **SSL policy** on App Gateway  
- Confirm **encryption configuration** in Storage or SQL  

---

## 🔷 Layer 7 — Application: Apps, APIs & Data Services

**Concept:** End-user and application-level communication  
**Azure Reality:** Where workloads and user experiences live  

**Services:**
- **IaaS:** IIS / NGINX / Custom web apps on VMs  
- **PaaS:**  
  - App Service  
  - Functions (serverless)  
  - AKS / Container Apps  
  - Logic Apps  
  - API Management  
  - Application Gateway (WAF)  
  - Storage Blob / Queue / Table APIs  
  - SQL Database / Cosmos DB  
- **SaaS:** Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Power BI  

**Troubleshooting:**
- Use **Application Insights** to trace requests and dependencies  
- Run **App Service Diagnostics → Availability & Performance**  
- Check **Front Door or App Gateway WAF logs**  
- Review API exceptions and HTTP codes (403, 409)  
- Validate DNS and endpoint reachability

## ⚙️ Applying the OSI Model in Real Troubleshooting

> When something breaks — start low, climb up.

**Example: A VM can’t access a Storage Account**
1. **Layer 3:** Check VNet routes and Private Endpoint connectivity  
2. **Layer 4:** Verify port 443 open in NSG or Firewall  
3. **Layer 5:** Validate SAS token or AD permissions  
4. **Layer 6:** Confirm TLS handshake / cert expiry  
5. **Layer 7:** Review app logs and Storage API responses  

**Example: App Service can’t reach SQL Database**
- Start with **DNS & VNet integration (L3)**  
- Check **port 1433 (L4)**  
- Verify **managed identity (L5)**  
- Review **SSL policy (L6)**  
- Inspect **query errors (L7)**

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- The OSI model is a **cloud-agnostic troubleshooting map**.  
- Azure’s layers stack cleanly across IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.  
- Starting from the bottom prevents chasing phantom “app” issues caused by simple network misconfigurations.

## 💬 Final Thought

The next time your app “just stops working,” don’t panic — **walk the stack**.

Layer 1: Is Azure itself healthy?  
Layer 2–3: Is the network open?  
Layer 4–6: Is the path secure and the session valid?  
Layer 7: Is your app behaving?

Master these seven questions, and you’ll troubleshoot Azure like a pro.
