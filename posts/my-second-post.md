# Terraforming Azure Networks

In this guide, weâ€™ll create a hub-spoke network in Azure with Terraform.

```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "hub" {
  name                = "hub-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = "eastus"
  resource_group_name = "rg-network"
}
