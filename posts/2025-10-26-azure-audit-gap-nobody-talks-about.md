## The Question That Starts the Panic

"Who created this storage account three months ago?"

You're sitting in a meeting. Security is investigating potential data exposure. Leadership wants answers. You confidently open Azure Portal, navigate to Activity Logs, and...

**The data is gone.**

Azure Activity Logs keep 90 days by default. Your regulatory requirements demand 5-7 years. And this moment - when you realize you can't answer basic audit questions - is how most organizations discover they're silently non-compliant.

## The Three-Part Audit Problem

Let me break down what's actually happening in most Azure environments:

### Part 1: Do You HAVE the Logs?

This is about retention configuration. Out of the box, Azure gives you:

- **Activity Logs (ARM resources):** 90 days in the portal
- **Azure AD Audit Logs:** 30 days in the portal
- **That's it.**

Meanwhile, regulatory frameworks demand:
- **SOX:** 7 years
- **HIPAA:** 6 years  
- **GDPR:** Varies by data category
- **PCI-DSS:** 1 year online, 3 years archive
- **State regulations:** Often 5-7 years

**The gap:** You're configured for 90 days, but legally required to keep 5-7 years. Most organizations don't discover this until they're asked to produce logs they don't have.

### Part 2: Do You KNOW WHERE the Logs Are?

Even if you've configured log retention properly, there's a documentation problem. Your logs might be scattered across:

- Activity Logs in the portal (90 days)
- Log Analytics Workspace (configured retention, maybe 30-730 days)
- Storage Account archive (hopefully years)
- Azure Monitor diagnostic settings (per-resource configuration)
- Azure AD Audit Logs (separate system entirely)

When the auditor asks "show me who accessed this storage account in Q2 2023," can you immediately answer:
1. WHERE that data lives?
2. HOW to query it?
3. WHO has access to retrieve it?

Most teams spend 4 hours scrambling to find WHERE the data is before they can even start answering the actual question.

### Part 3: Can You QUERY the Logs?

You've exported logs to a Log Analytics Workspace. Great! Now what?

You need to:
- Know KQL (Kusto Query Language)
- Understand the schema differences between Activity Logs and Azure AD logs
- Build custom queries for common audit scenarios
- Document those queries so you're not rebuilding them every audit cycle

**The reality:** Most organizations have configured retention (Part 1), but lack the query skills (Part 3) to actually extract answers when needed.

## The Two Separate Audit Systems

Here's what trips up most Azure admins: **You're not dealing with one audit system. You're dealing with two.**

### System 1: Azure Activity Logs (ARM Resources)

This covers your ARM resources:
- Virtual machines
- Storage accounts
- Virtual networks
- Key vaults
- Managed disks
- Resource groups

**Where it lives:** Azure Resource Manager (ARM) / Azure Monitor  
**Query tool:** Resource Graph (for resources) + Log Analytics (for activity)  
**Retention default:** 90 days in portal

### System 2: Azure AD Audit Logs (Identity Resources)

This covers your identity layer:
- App registrations
- Service principals  
- Enterprise applications
- User sign-ins
- Admin consent grants
- Role assignments

**Where it lives:** Azure Active Directory / Microsoft Entra ID  
**Query tool:** Microsoft Graph API or Log Analytics (if exported)  
**Retention default:** 30 days in portal

**The problem:** Most people only monitor ONE of these systems and completely miss the other.

## The App Registration Blind Spot

Let me tell you about the alert that drives every Azure admin crazy:

**Tenable Scanner Alert:** "Unused app registration detected with client secret expiring in 30 days"

You get 50 of these every month. And every single one triggers the same questions:
- Who created this app registration?
- What does it do?
- Is it still being used?
- Who owns it?

Here's why these alerts are so painful:

### App Registrations Can't Be Tagged

App registrations are **NOT ARM resources**. They're Azure AD objects.

That means:
- ❌ No tags (can't apply Cost Center, Owner, Environment tags)
- ❌ No Resource Graph support (can't query them with KQL in Resource Graph)
- ❌ Different audit system (Azure AD logs, not Activity Logs)
- ❌ Different API (Microsoft Graph, not Azure Resource Manager)

### The Ownership Problem

When you create a VM, you can tag it: `Owner: john.doe@company.com`

When you create an app registration, you get:
- A GUID
- A display name (if they bothered to make it descriptive)
- Maybe a description (if you're lucky)
- An "Owners" field... that's often empty

Three months later, when security asks "who created this?", you're digging through Azure AD audit logs hoping the data is still there.

### The Real-World Scenario

**Security Team Email:** "We found an app registration 'MyApp-Test-042' with a client secret expiring in 2 days. Is this still needed?"

Your investigation process:
1. Search Azure AD Audit Logs (hoping it's within 30 days)
2. Find the creation event (maybe)
3. Look up the user who created it (probably someone who left 6 months ago)
4. Search Slack/Teams for any mention of 'MyApp-Test-042' (desperate times)
5. Ask around until someone recognizes it (maybe)
6. Make a judgment call (coin flip)

**This happens every single day in large Azure environments.**

## The Day-to-Day Pain Points

Let me show you the questions you get constantly and why they're so painful to answer:

### Question 1: "Who created this resource?"

**Scenario:** A storage account appears in a production resource group. Nobody recognizes it. Leadership wants to know who created it and why.

**The pain:**
- Check Activity Logs → Only goes back 90 days, creation was 4 months ago
- Check Resource Tags → No Owner tag applied
- Check Resource creation logs → Not exported to Log Analytics
- **Answer:** "I don't know. The logs are gone."

### Question 2: "Who accessed this storage account?"

**Scenario:** Compliance asks for a list of everyone who accessed a specific storage account during Q2 2024 for audit documentation.

**The pain:**
- Activity Logs show ARM operations (create, delete, update) but not data plane access
- Storage Analytics logs are separate and may not be enabled
- Diagnostic settings might not be configured
- **Answer:** "Let me get back to you... tomorrow... maybe."

### Question 3: "What did John Doe create before he left?"

**Scenario:** Employee departed 6 months ago. ITSM ticket: Remove all resources created by john.doe@company.com

**The pain:**
- Activity Logs only go back 90 days
- Resource Graph shows current owners (tags) but not who created resources
- No historical audit trail unless exported
- **Answer:** "I can show you resources he currently owns, but not everything he created."

### Question 4: "Who granted admin consent to this app registration?"

**Scenario:** Security scan finds an app with excessive permissions. Need to track down who approved it and why.

**The pain:**
- App registrations are in Azure AD, not ARM
- Requires Azure AD Audit Logs (30-day default retention)
- If it happened 31 days ago, the data is gone
- **Answer:** "The audit log doesn't go back that far."

### Question 5: "Is this app registration still being used?"

**Scenario:** 50 app registrations flagged by Tenable. Security wants to delete unused ones.

**The pain:**
- No built-in "last used" metric for app registrations
- Sign-in logs might show service principal activity
- No correlation between client secret and actual usage
- **Answer:** "We'd have to monitor sign-in logs for 30-90 days to be sure."

**The pattern:** You spend 4 hours scrambling to find WHERE the data is, then realize it doesn't exist or isn't accessible.

## The Solution Architecture

Here's how to fix this before your next audit. This is not theoretical - this is what I implemented at a regional bank handling SOX compliance.

### Step 1: Configure Log Export

You need to export logs from their 30/90-day defaults to long-term storage.

#### Export Activity Logs to Log Analytics

```bash
# Create or identify your Log Analytics Workspace
$workspaceName = "audit-logs-workspace"
$resourceGroup = "governance-rg"
$location = "eastus"

# Create workspace if it doesn't exist
az monitor log-analytics workspace create `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --workspace-name $workspaceName `
  --location $location `
  --retention-time 730  # 2 years retention in LAW
```

#### Configure Diagnostic Settings for Activity Logs

```bash
# Export subscription-level Activity Logs to Log Analytics
$subscriptionId = (az account show --query id -o tsv)
$workspaceId = (az monitor log-analytics workspace show `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --workspace-name $workspaceName `
  --query id -o tsv)

az monitor diagnostic-settings create `
  --name "export-activity-logs" `
  --resource "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId" `
  --workspace $workspaceId `
  --logs '[
    {
      "category": "Administrative",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "category": "Security",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "category": "ServiceHealth",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "category": "Alert",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "category": "Recommendation",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "category": "Policy",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "category": "Autoscale",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "category": "ResourceHealth",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]'
```

#### Export Azure AD Audit Logs

This requires Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 licensing.

```bash
# Configure Azure AD diagnostic settings via Portal or API
# Navigate to: Azure AD > Diagnostic settings > Add diagnostic setting
# Select:
# - AuditLogs (who did what in Azure AD)
# - SignInLogs (authentication events)
# - NonInteractiveUserSignInLogs (service principal activity)
# - ServicePrincipalSignInLogs (app registration usage)
# - ManagedIdentitySignInLogs (managed identity activity)

# Destination: Same Log Analytics Workspace
```

**PowerShell equivalent:**

```powershell
# Connect to Azure AD
Connect-AzureAD

# Get the Log Analytics Workspace resource ID
$workspaceResourceId = "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/$workspaceName"

# Configure diagnostic settings for Azure AD
# Note: This requires Microsoft.Graph PowerShell module
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "AuditLog.Read.All", "Directory.Read.All"

# Create diagnostic setting
$params = @{
    Name = "export-azuread-logs"
    WorkspaceId = $workspaceResourceId
    Logs = @(
        @{ Category = "AuditLogs"; Enabled = $true }
        @{ Category = "SignInLogs"; Enabled = $true }
        @{ Category = "NonInteractiveUserSignInLogs"; Enabled = $true }
        @{ Category = "ServicePrincipalSignInLogs"; Enabled = $true }
        @{ Category = "ManagedIdentitySignInLogs"; Enabled = $true }
    )
}

# Apply at tenant level
New-MgBetaDiagnosticSetting -BodyParameter $params
```

#### Export to Storage Account for Long-Term Archive

Log Analytics is great for querying (30-730 days), but expensive for 7-year retention. Use Storage Accounts for cheap archive.

```bash
# Create storage account for audit archive
$storageAccountName = "auditarchive$(Get-Random)"
az storage account create `
  --name $storageAccountName `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --location $location `
  --sku Standard_LRS `
  --kind StorageV2 `
  --access-tier Cool  # Cool tier for infrequent access

# Get storage account resource ID
$storageId = (az storage account show `
  --name $storageAccountName `
  --resource-group $resourceGroup `
  --query id -o tsv)

# Update diagnostic settings to include storage
az monitor diagnostic-settings create `
  --name "export-activity-logs-storage" `
  --resource "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId" `
  --storage-account $storageId `
  --logs '[
    {
      "category": "Administrative",
      "enabled": true,
      "retentionPolicy": {
        "enabled": true,
        "days": 2555
      }
    }
  ]'
```

**Cost breakdown:**
- Log Analytics: ~$2.50 per GB ingested + $0.12 per GB retention per month
- Storage Account (Cool tier): ~$0.01 per GB per month
- **For 7-year retention:** Storage is 95% cheaper than Log Analytics

### Step 2: Build Your Query Library

You need pre-built KQL queries for common audit scenarios. Don't rebuild these every time.

#### Query 1: Who Created This Resource?

```kusto
// Find who created a specific resource by name
AzureActivity
| where OperationNameValue == "MICROSOFT.RESOURCES/DEPLOYMENTS/WRITE" 
    or OperationNameValue contains "CREATE"
    or OperationNameValue contains "WRITE"
| where ResourceId contains "your-resource-name"  // Replace with actual resource name
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Success"
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    Caller,  // Who did it
    ResourceId,  // What was created
    OperationNameValue,  // What action
    ActivityStatusValue,  // Success/Failure
    Claims  // Full identity context
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| take 100
```

#### Query 2: All Actions by a Specific User

```kusto
// Find everything a user did (useful for offboarding investigations)
AzureActivity
| where Caller contains "john.doe@company.com"  // Replace with actual user
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(90d)  // Adjust time range as needed
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    ResourceGroup,
    ResourceId,
    OperationNameValue,
    ActivityStatusValue
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

#### Query 3: Resource Deletions

```kusto
// Track all resource deletions (critical for audit trails)
AzureActivity
| where OperationNameValue contains "DELETE"
| where ActivityStatusValue == "Success"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(90d)
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    Caller,
    ResourceId,
    ResourceGroup,
    OperationNameValue
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

#### Query 4: Who Granted Admin Consent to an App?

```kusto
// Track admin consent grants (Azure AD Audit Logs)
AuditLogs
| where OperationName == "Consent to application"
| where Result == "success"
| extend 
    AppName = tostring(TargetResources[0].displayName),
    ConsentedBy = tostring(InitiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName),
    Permissions = tostring(TargetResources[0].modifiedProperties)
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    ConsentedBy,
    AppName,
    Permissions,
    CorrelationId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

#### Query 5: App Registration Creation and Ownership

```kusto
// Track app registration creation (Azure AD Audit Logs)
AuditLogs
| where OperationName == "Add application"
| where Result == "success"
| extend 
    AppName = tostring(TargetResources[0].displayName),
    CreatedBy = tostring(InitiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName),
    AppId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    CreatedBy,
    AppName,
    AppId,
    CorrelationId
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

#### Query 6: Service Principal Sign-In Activity

```kusto
// Check if an app registration is actually being used
AADServicePrincipalSignInLogs
| where AppId == "your-app-id-guid"  // Replace with actual App ID
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(90d)
| summarize 
    SignInCount = count(),
    LastSignIn = max(TimeGenerated),
    UniqueResources = dcount(ResourceId)
    by AppDisplayName, AppId
| project 
    AppDisplayName,
    AppId,
    SignInCount,
    LastSignIn,
    UniqueResources
```

#### Query 7: Storage Account Access (Data Plane)

```kusto
// Track who accessed storage account data (requires diagnostic settings on storage)
StorageBlobLogs
| where AccountName == "yourstorageaccount"  // Replace with actual storage account
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(30d)
| where StatusCode == 200  // Successful operations
| extend CallerIdentity = tostring(parse_json(Identity).claims.upn)
| summarize 
    AccessCount = count(),
    LastAccess = max(TimeGenerated)
    by CallerIdentity, OperationName
| order by AccessCount desc
```

### Step 3: Document Your Logging Architecture

Create a one-page reference document that answers:

**Audit Log Documentation Template:**

```markdown
# Azure Audit Logging Architecture

## Log Analytics Workspace
- **Name:** audit-logs-workspace
- **Resource Group:** governance-rg
- **Retention:** 730 days (2 years)
- **Access:** Security team, Compliance team, IT leadership

## Storage Account Archive
- **Name:** auditarchiveXXXXXX
- **Resource Group:** governance-rg
- **Retention:** 2,555 days (7 years)
- **Access:** Compliance team only (RBAC locked down)

## What's Collected

### Activity Logs (ARM Resources)
- All subscriptions configured with diagnostic settings
- Categories: Administrative, Security, Policy, Alerts
- Retention: 730 days in LAW, 7 years in Storage

### Azure AD Audit Logs
- AuditLogs (who did what in Azure AD)
- SignInLogs (user authentication)
- ServicePrincipalSignInLogs (app registration usage)
- Retention: 730 days in LAW, 7 years in Storage

## How to Query

### Portal Access
1. Navigate to: Log Analytics Workspace > Logs
2. Select "audit-logs-workspace"
3. Use pre-built queries from: [Link to internal wiki/SharePoint]

### Common Queries
- Who created this resource? → Query #1
- What did user X do? → Query #2
- Resource deletions → Query #3
- App consent grants → Query #4

## Quarterly Audit Process
1. Compliance team requests specific queries
2. IT runs queries from template library
3. Export results to Excel/CSV
4. Compliance validates and archives

## Contacts
- **IT Governance:** your-team@company.com
- **Compliance:** compliance@company.com
- **Azure Admin:** azure-admins@company.com
```

**Save this document where your team can find it.** SharePoint, Confluence, internal wiki - wherever you keep runbooks.

### Step 4: External Tracking for App Registrations

Since app registrations can't be tagged, you need external tracking.

**Option 1: Spreadsheet (Quick Start)**

Create a simple tracking sheet:

| App Name | App ID | Created By | Created Date | Purpose | Owner | Status | Last Review |
|----------|--------|------------|--------------|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| MyApp-Prod | guid | john.doe | 2024-03-15 | Production API | Jane Smith | Active | 2024-10-01 |
| TestApp-042 | guid | old.user | 2023-08-22 | Testing | Unknown | Review | 2024-10-01 |

**Update process:**
- New app registration? Add row
- Quarterly review? Update Status and Last Review
- Tenable alert? Check this sheet first

**Option 2: CMDB Integration (Enterprise)**

If you have a CMDB (ServiceNow, Azure DevOps, Jira), create:
- CI Type: "Azure App Registration"
- Automated sync via Microsoft Graph API
- Link to resource owner records

**Option 3: Automation Script**

```powershell
# Export all app registrations to CSV for tracking
Connect-AzureAD

$apps = Get-AzureADApplication -All $true
$report = @()

foreach ($app in $apps) {
    $owners = Get-AzureADApplicationOwner -ObjectId $app.ObjectId
    
    $report += [PSCustomObject]@{
        DisplayName = $app.DisplayName
        AppId = $app.AppId
        ObjectId = $app.ObjectId
        CreatedDateTime = $app.CreatedDateTime
        Owners = ($owners.UserPrincipalName -join "; ")
        SignInAudience = $app.SignInAudience
        PublisherDomain = $app.PublisherDomain
    }
}

$report | Export-Csv -Path "app-registrations-inventory.csv" -NoTypeInformation

Write-Host "Exported $($report.Count) app registrations to CSV"
```

Run this monthly. Compare to last month's export. Flag new apps without owners.

### Step 5: Test Quarterly (Audit Drills)

Don't wait for a real audit to discover your logging is broken. Run drills.

**Quarterly Audit Drill Checklist:**

```markdown
# Q4 2025 Audit Drill

## Test Date: October 26, 2025
## Tester: [Your Name]

### Test 1: Log Retention Verification
- [ ] Verify Activity Logs retention: Query logs from 90+ days ago
- [ ] Verify Azure AD logs retention: Query AuditLogs from 30+ days ago
- [ ] Verify Storage Account archive: Check oldest logs in storage
- [ ] **Result:** Pass/Fail + Notes

### Test 2: Query Execution
- [ ] Run Query #1: Who created resource X? (pick random VM)
- [ ] Run Query #2: What did user Y do? (pick random user)
- [ ] Run Query #4: Recent admin consent grants
- [ ] **Result:** Pass/Fail + Notes

### Test 3: Documentation Access
- [ ] Locate audit documentation
- [ ] Verify links to Log Analytics Workspace
- [ ] Verify query library is up to date
- [ ] **Result:** Pass/Fail + Notes

### Test 4: App Registration Tracking

- [ ] **Result:** Pass/Fail + Notes

## Issues Found:
[List any issues discovered during drill]

## Action Items:
- [ ] Fix issue #1
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Retest in 30 days

## Next Drill: January 26, 2026
```

**Why quarterly?** 
- Catches configuration drift before audit season
- Validates your team knows where logs are
- Proves your retention is actually working

## What This Looks Like in Production

Let me show you what this setup looks like at scale.

### Synovus Example (Regional Bank, SOX Compliance)

**Environment:**
- 44 Azure subscriptions
- 21 Active Directory domains (consolidating)
- 300+ applications
- SOX audit requirement: 7 years

**What we implemented:**

1. **Centralized Log Analytics Workspace**
   - One workspace for all subscriptions
   - 730-day retention (balancing cost vs query access)
   - Configured via Azure Policy (automatic for new subscriptions)

2. **Storage Account Archive**
   - Separate storage account per compliance zone
   - 7-year retention
   - Immutable storage (WORM) for tamper-proof logs
   - Lifecycle management (auto-archive to Cool tier after 90 days)

3. **Query Library**
   - 25 pre-built queries for common audit scenarios
   - Stored in internal wiki with examples
   - Updated quarterly based on actual audit requests

4. **App Registration Tracking**
   - CSV export automated monthly via Azure Automation
   - Stored in SharePoint with version history
   - Quarterly review with security team
   - Tenable alerts cross-referenced against this inventory

5. **Azure Policy Enforcement**
   - Diagnostic settings automatically applied to new subscriptions
   - Activity Log export mandatory via policy
   - Storage account lifecycle management enforced

**Cost:**
- Log Analytics: ~$800/month (all subscriptions)
- Storage Account: ~$50/month (7 years of logs)
- **Total:** ~$850/month for complete audit compliance

**ROI:**
- First SOX audit: 4 hours to produce all requested logs (vs. weeks previously)
- Security incidents: Immediate answers to "who did what when"
- Offboarding: Complete audit trail of departed employee actions

### Small Environment Example (Startup, 1-3 Subscriptions)

Don't overthink it if you're small. Start simple:

**Minimum Viable Setup:**

1. **One Log Analytics Workspace**
   - 90-day retention (free tier: 5GB/month)
   - Activity Logs exported from all subscriptions
   - Azure AD logs exported (requires Azure AD Premium P1)

2. **One Storage Account**
   - Standard LRS, Cool tier
   - 1-year retention (extend as budget allows)

3. **Five Core Queries**
   - Who created this?
   - What did this user do?
   - Resource deletions
   - Admin consent grants
   - App registration creation

4. **Simple App Tracking**
   - Excel spreadsheet
   - Updated when Tenable alerts fire
   - Quarterly manual review

**Cost:**
- Log Analytics: $0-50/month (depending on log volume)
- Storage Account: $5-10/month
- **Total:** ~$60/month or less

**When to upgrade:**
- Growing past 5 subscriptions → Enforce with Azure Policy
- Getting audited → Extend retention to match requirements
- Multiple teams → Add RBAC and centralized governance

## The Business Case for Leadership

If you need budget approval, here's your talking points:

### The Risk (What Happens If We Don't)

**Scenario 1: Failed Audit**
- Auditor requests logs from 18 months ago
- You can't produce them (90-day default)
- **Result:** Audit finding, potential compliance penalty, reputational damage

**Scenario 2: Security Incident**
- Breach detected, forensics team needs 6 months of logs
- Activity Logs only go back 90 days
- **Result:** Can't determine scope of breach, can't identify entry point, liability exposure

**Scenario 3: Offboarding Investigation**
- Employee leaves, manager wants to know what they had access to
- No historical audit trail
- **Result:** 40 hours of manual investigation, incomplete results

### The Cost (What It Actually Takes)

**Setup:**
- Engineering time: 8-16 hours (one-time)
- Monthly cost: $50-1,000 depending on scale
- Quarterly testing: 2 hours per quarter

**ROI:**
- First audit: 80% time savings (hours vs. weeks)
- Security incidents: Immediate forensics capability
- Offboarding: 90% time savings (2 hours vs. 40 hours)

**Budget ask:**
- Small environment: $1,000/year
- Medium environment: $10,000/year  
- Enterprise environment: $50,000/year

**Comparison:**
- One failed audit finding: $50,000-500,000 in remediation + penalties
- One security breach investigation: $100,000+ in consulting fees
- This solution: $1,000-50,000/year

**Approval probability: Very high.**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

I've seen these mistakes repeatedly. Don't repeat them.

### Mistake 1: "We'll Set It Up When We Need It"

**The problem:** By the time you need audit logs, it's too late. You can't retroactively create historical data.

**The fix:** Set up retention BEFORE your next audit cycle. If you're audited in Q1 2026, configure this by end of Q4 2025.

### Mistake 2: "We Only Need Activity Logs"

**The problem:** Activity Logs cover ARM resources (VMs, storage). You're missing the entire identity layer (app registrations, consent grants, role assignments).

**The fix:** Export BOTH Activity Logs and Azure AD Audit Logs. They're separate systems covering different types of actions.

### Mistake 3: "Log Analytics Retention = Archive"

**The problem:** Log Analytics retention (30-730 days) is great for querying, but expensive for 5-7 year archive requirements.

**The fix:** Use Log Analytics for recent logs (90-730 days), then archive to Storage Account for long-term retention. It's 95% cheaper.

### Mistake 4: "We'll Query the Storage Account When Needed"

**The problem:** Querying logs directly from Storage Account is painful. No KQL support, just raw JSON files.

**The fix:** Log Analytics for query access (recent logs), Storage Account for compliance archive (old logs you rarely need).

### Mistake 5: "Tagging Solves Everything"

**The problem:** Tags are great for ARM resources, but app registrations can't be tagged. You need separate tracking.

**The fix:** External tracking system (spreadsheet, CMDB, automated export) for app registrations. Update it monthly.

### Mistake 6: "Set It and Forget It"

**The problem:** Diagnostic settings get deleted. Log Analytics fills up. Storage accounts get misconfigured. No one notices until the audit.

**The fix:** Quarterly audit drills. Test your queries. Verify your retention. Update your documentation.

## The 30-Minute Quick Start

If you're reading this during an audit crisis, here's your emergency process:

### Hour 1: Verify What You Have

```kusto
// Check Activity Log retention
AzureActivity
| summarize 
    OldestLog = min(TimeGenerated),
    NewestLog = max(TimeGenerated),
    DaysCovered = datetime_diff('day', max(TimeGenerated), min(TimeGenerated))
| project OldestLog, NewestLog, DaysCovered
```

```kusto
// Check Azure AD log retention  
AuditLogs
| summarize 
    OldestLog = min(TimeGenerated),
    NewestLog = max(TimeGenerated),
    DaysCovered = datetime_diff('day', max(TimeGenerated), min(TimeGenerated))
| project OldestLog, NewestLog, DaysCovered
```

**If DaysCovered < 90:** You're running on defaults. You need to configure exports NOW.

### Hour 2: Configure Exports (Emergency Mode)

```bash
# Quick setup: Export logs to new Log Analytics Workspace
az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
  --resource-group emergency-audit-rg \
  --workspace-name emergency-audit-logs \
  --location eastus \
  --retention-time 730

# Get workspace ID
workspaceId=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show \
  --resource-group emergency-audit-rg \
  --workspace-name emergency-audit-logs \
  --query id -o tsv)

# Configure diagnostic settings for current subscription
subscriptionId=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
  --name emergency-export \
  --resource "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId" \
  --workspace $workspaceId \
  --logs '[{"category":"Administrative","enabled":true}]'
```

**Important:** This only captures NEW logs going forward. You can't recover old logs that already expired.

### Hour 3: Document What You've Done

Create a one-page summary:
- What logs are being captured NOW
- Where they're going (workspace name, resource group)
- How long we'll keep them (retention setting)
- What logs we DON'T have (date ranges we lost)

**Be honest in your audit:** "We discovered a gap in our retention configuration. We've corrected it as of [date]. Historical logs prior to [date] are not available."

## The Takeaway

Most Azure environments are silently non-compliant with audit requirements because nobody talks about the 90-day default.

**The three-part problem:**
1. Do you HAVE the logs? (retention configuration)
2. Do you KNOW WHERE they are? (documentation gap)
3. Can you QUERY them? (skills gap)

**The solution:**
1. Export Activity Logs + Azure AD logs to Log Analytics + Storage
2. Build a query library for common audit scenarios
3. Document your logging architecture
4. Track app registrations externally (they can't be tagged)
5. Test quarterly with audit drills

**The cost:** $50-1,000/month depending on scale.

**The ROI:** You'll know this was worth it the moment someone asks "who created this resource 6 months ago?" and you actually have an answer.

**What's your audit logging setup look like?** Are you running on the 90-day default, or have you built something more robust? Reply in the comments or shoot me an email - I'd love to hear how other organizations are handling this.

And if you found this useful, share it with your compliance team. They'll thank you during the next audit cycle.
