# If You're Going to Azure, Better Have a Yard Sale and a Roll-Off Ready

**The Azure Migration Phase Nobody Budgets For**

The application rationalization workshop went exactly as expected.

200 applications in the inventory. We mapped them to the 6 R's framework:
- **Rehost:** 120 apps (lift-and-shift to Azure)
- **Replatform:** 40 apps (minor changes for PaaS)
- **Refactor:** 20 apps (re-architect for cloud-native)
- **Repurchase:** 10 apps (move to SaaS)
- **Retain:** 10 apps (keep on-prem for now)
- **Retire:** 100 apps (decommission - no longer needed)

Finance lit up when they saw "Retire."

"We only have to migrate 190 apps instead of 200? That's a 50% reduction in migration work! This is going to save us millions!"

Six months later, Finance called a meeting.

"Why are we still paying for the old data center? I thought we retired those applications."

I pulled up the decommission project tracker.

"We did retire them. Officially. They're just... still running."

"Why?"

"Because decommissioning 100 retired applications turns out to be a 6-month project that costs over $100,000 and requires someone to coordinate yard sales and rent dumpsters."

Finance stared at me.

"You're joking."

I was not joking.

## The 6 R's Framework Everyone Celebrates

If you're planning an Azure migration, you've heard about the 6 R's (or 7 R's, depending on which consultant you hired):

1. **Rehost** - Lift-and-shift to Azure VMs
2. **Replatform** - Minor changes to use PaaS
3. **Refactor** - Re-architect for cloud-native
4. **Rebuild** - Complete redevelopment
5. **Retire** - Decommission apps no longer needed
6. **Retain** - Keep on-prem temporarily
7. *(Sometimes)* **Repurchase** - Move to SaaS

**Everyone focuses on the first four Rs.** That's where the migration work happens. That's where application teams spend their time. That's where consultants bill hours.

**Finance focuses on the "Retire" R.** Because that's where the savings are.

"We identified 100 applications that nobody uses anymore. We can retire them instead of migrating them. Look at all the money we're saving!"

**What Finance thinks "Retire" means:**
- Stop paying for them ✅
- Instant cost reduction ✅
- No migration work required ✅

**What "Retire" actually means:**
- Someone has to physically decommission the hardware
- Someone has to verify nobody actually needs them (they lied on the survey)
- Someone has to handle data destruction (compliance requirement)
- Someone has to dispose of the hardware (e-waste regulations)
- Someone has to cancel maintenance contracts (procurement hell)
- Someone has to coordinate all this (6-month project nobody budgeted)

**The gap between those two definitions is where your yard sale and roll-off dumpster come in.**

## Application Rationalization: The Setup for Disappointment

During application rationalization, you survey application owners:

"Do you still use this application?"

**What they say:**
- "No, we haven't used that in years."
- "That's been replaced by the new system."
- "Pretty sure nobody even remembers the password."

**What you hear:**
Finance: "Retire it! That's 100 fewer applications to migrate!"

**What you should hear:**
"That application runs on physical servers that are now officially obsolete but still consuming power, taking up rack space, and costing money every month until someone actually decommissions them."

**The difference:** The word "Retire" sounds like a decision. In reality, it's the START of a project.

---

## The Zombie Infrastructure Period

Here's what actually happens after you "retire" 100 applications:

### Month 1: Officially Retired
- Applications marked as "Retired" in the CMDB
- Migration team moves on to actual migration work
- Infrastructure team waits for someone to tell them when to power down
- Finance expects cost savings to appear

### Month 2: The "Just to Be Sure" Phase
Application owner: "I know we said we don't use it, but let's give it another month. Just to be sure nobody's using it."

Infrastructure team: "Okay, we'll leave them running."

### Month 3: The "We're Busy with Migration" Phase
Cloud team: "We can't focus on decommissioning right now. We're busy migrating the 190 apps that actually matter."

Infrastructure team: "Makes sense. We'll get to it later."

### Month 4: Finance Notices
CFO: "Why is our data center bill still the same? I thought we retired 100 applications."

CIO: "Technically we did retire them. They're just... still physically running."

CFO: "..."

### Month 6: The Meeting
Subject line: "Data Center Decommission Project Kickoff"

Finance: "Wait, this is a PROJECT? Can't we just turn them off?"

You: "That's... not how this works."

### Month 9: Still Running
The servers are STILL sitting there because:
- Nobody wants to be the one to actually pull the plug
- Nobody budgeted for decommissioning
- Nobody owns the project
- Everyone's busy with the migration

**This is zombie infrastructure:** Officially dead, but still consuming resources.

## The Yard Sale

Eventually, someone has to deal with the physical hardware.

You call an ITAD (IT Asset Disposition) vendor for a quote.

"What's the resale value of our retired servers?"

They send back a spreadsheet:

**Your Hardware:**
- Dell PowerEdge R640 servers (5 years old)
- Original purchase price: $8,000 per server
- Quantity: 50 servers
- Total original investment: $400,000

**Current Market Value:**
- Resale value per server: $150-250
- Total resale value: $7,500-12,500
- **Recovery rate: 2-3% of original purchase price**

**You just lost 97% of your hardware investment.**

But wait, it gets better.

The ITAD vendor continues:
"For servers older than 5 years, we typically charge $50-100 per unit for pickup and disposal after data destruction costs. Net proceeds: Near zero or negative."

**Translation:** Your 5-year-old servers are worth LESS than nothing after you account for:
- Data destruction (required by compliance)
- Transportation and logistics
- Environmental disposal fees
- Vendor service fees

**You're not having a yard sale. You're paying people to take your stuff away.**

---

## The Roll-Off (Reality Check)

"Roll-off" is industry slang for a dumpster on wheels.

When the ITAD vendor arrives, here's what actually happens:

### Data Destruction Requirements

Every hard drive requires certified destruction:

**Per-Drive Costs:**
- Physical shredding: $50-100 per drive
- Certificate of destruction: $10-25 per drive
- Compliance documentation: Included (but time-consuming)

**Your Math:**
- 100 retired applications
- Average 5 servers per app
- Average 4 drives per server
- Total drives: 2,000 drives
- Data destruction cost: $100,000-200,000

**That's MORE than the original resale value of all the hardware.**

### E-Waste Disposal

Servers contain hazardous materials:
- Lead (solder, CRT displays)
- Mercury (switches, thermostats)
- Cadmium (batteries)
- Lithium (UPS systems)

**You can't just throw them in a dumpster.**

**E-Waste Disposal Requirements:**
- Certified e-waste recycler (R2/e-Stewards certification)
- Hazardous materials handling fees
- Transportation costs
- Certificate of recycling
- Environmental impact reporting (for ESG compliance)

**Typical Disposal Costs:**
- Small servers: $25-50 per unit
- Large servers: $75-150 per unit
- Networking equipment: $10-30 per unit
- Storage arrays: $200-500 per unit
- UPS systems: $100-300 per unit

**Your retired 100 applications probably include:**
- 500 servers
- 200 network switches
- 50 storage arrays
- 50 UPS systems

**Total disposal cost: $50,000-100,000**

### The Actual Roll-Off Day

The ITAD vendor arrives with:
- A 40-foot roll-off dumpster
- A crew of 6-8 people
- Pallet jacks and forklifts
- Shrink wrap and pallets
- Security escort (because data is still on the drives)

They spend 2-3 days:
- Disconnecting equipment
- Removing from racks
- Palletizing for transportation
- Loading the roll-off
- Documenting serial numbers (chain of custody)

**When they leave:**
- Your data center has empty racks
- You have a huge bill for disposal
- Finance is shocked at the cost

"We thought RETIRING apps would SAVE money."

It does. Eventually. After you pay for the yard sale nobody came to and the roll-off dumpster full of hardware that's worthless.

## Why It Takes 6 Months (The Real Timeline)

Finance thinks: "Just turn them off."

Reality: Multi-phase project with dependencies.

### Phase 1: Verification (Weeks 1-8)
- Confirm applications are actually unused (survey owners AGAIN)
- Check for hidden dependencies (nobody mentioned during rationalization)
- Verify backups exist (compliance requirement)
- Document current state (audit trail)
- Get executive sign-off (CYA)

**Why this takes 8 weeks:** Because every application owner who said "we don't use it" suddenly remembers a critical process that runs once a quarter.

### Phase 2: Graceful Shutdown (Weeks 9-12)
- Schedule maintenance windows
- Notify all stakeholders (even if they said they don't use it)
- Power down applications in logical order
- Monitor for unexpected issues
- Keep backups accessible (30-day minimum hold)

**Why this takes 4 weeks:** Because you WILL discover someone was using that "retired" application, and you need time to deal with the fallout.

### Phase 3: Data Retention (Weeks 13-20)
- Archive data per compliance policies
- Maintain backups (legal hold, retention policies)
- Document data location (audit trail)
- Wait for legal to confirm no pending litigation

**Why this takes 8 weeks:** Because Legal says "better keep it for 90 days just in case."

### Phase 4: Physical Decommission (Weeks 21-24)
- ITAD vendor engagement (get quotes, select vendor)
- Schedule decommission (coordinate with data center)
- Physical removal (2-3 days of actual work)
- Data destruction (certified process)
- Certificate of destruction (documentation)
- Asset tracking updates (remove from inventory)

**Why this takes 4 weeks:** Because scheduling, vendor coordination, and paperwork take longer than the actual physical work.

### Phase 5: Contract Cleanup (Weeks 24-26)
- Cancel maintenance contracts (procurement process)
- Terminate software licenses (more procurement)
- Update asset inventory (IT ops)
- Close projects in PMO (documentation)
- Final financial reconciliation (Finance wants receipts)

**Why this takes 2+ weeks:** Because canceling contracts is ALWAYS harder than starting them.

**Total: 26 weeks = 6 months**

And that's assuming nothing goes wrong. Which it will.

## The Hidden Costs Finance Never Sees

When Finance celebrates "Retire," they think:

**100 apps retired = 100 apps we don't have to migrate = SAVINGS**

What they don't calculate:

### Labor Costs (The Biggest Hidden Cost)

**Project Management:**
- PM coordinating decommission: 20 hours/week × 26 weeks = 520 hours
- At $100/hour = $52,000

**Infrastructure Team:**
- Engineers executing decommission: 10 hours/week × 26 weeks = 260 hours
- At $80/hour = $20,800

**Application Teams:**
- Verification and sign-offs: 40 hours total across 100 apps
- At $90/hour = $3,600

**Compliance/Legal:**
- Data retention verification: 40 hours
- At $120/hour = $4,800

**Finance/Procurement:**
- Contract cancellations: 30 hours
- At $80/hour = $2,400

**Total Labor: $83,600**

### Service Costs

**Data Destruction:**
- 2,000 drives × $75 average = $150,000

**Equipment Disposal:**
- E-waste handling = $50,000

**ITAD Vendor Fees:**
- Project management, logistics, documentation = $15,000

**Minus Resale Recovery:**
- Hardware resale value = -$10,000

**Net Service Costs: $205,000**

### Ongoing Costs During Decommission

**Data Center Costs (While Waiting):**
- Colo space: $2,000/month × 6 months = $12,000
- Power: $1,000/month × 6 months = $6,000

**Total Ongoing: $18,000**

---

## The Grand Total

**Total cost to "retire" 100 applications:**
- Labor: $83,600
- Services: $205,000
- Ongoing: $18,000
- **Total: $306,600**

**Finance thought:** "We're saving money by not migrating these!"

**Reality:** "We're spending $306K to physically decommission hardware for apps we already decided not to migrate."

**The painful truth:** You're not avoiding migration costs. You're trading them for decommission costs.

And nobody budgeted for this.

---

## What Finance Should Actually Budget

When your application rationalization identifies apps to "Retire," Finance should immediately ask:

**"What's the decommission budget?"**

**Minimum Budget (Per Retired Application):**
- $500-1,000 for applications on shared infrastructure
- $2,000-5,000 for applications on dedicated hardware
- $10,000+ for applications with complex compliance requirements

**For 100 retired applications, budget $200K-500K for decommissioning.**

That's not a typo. That's the real cost of "Retire."

**What gets you to the high end:**
- Older hardware (worth nothing, costs money to dispose)
- Lots of storage (data destruction is expensive per-drive)
- Compliance requirements (legal holds, retention policies, audit trails)
- Multiple data centers (travel, logistics, coordination)
- Contract complexity (cancellation fees, notice periods)

**What gets you to the low end:**
- Newer hardware (actual resale value)
- Virtualized (fewer physical assets)
- Simple compliance (no special retention)
- Single location (easier logistics)
- Month-to-month contracts (easy cancellation)

**The average enterprise with mixed infrastructure? Plan for $300K.**

---

## The Organizational Problem Nobody Admits

Here's why decommissioning turns into a 6-month disaster:

**Nobody owns it.**

**Cloud Migration Team:** "We migrated the apps to Azure. Not our problem."

**Infrastructure Team:** "We'll power them down when someone tells us to."

**Application Teams:** "We stopped using those apps. Someone else deal with the hardware."

**Facilities:** "We manage the data center space. Not responsible for what's in the racks."

**Finance:** "We approved the migration budget. Nobody told us about decommissioning."

**Result:** Zombie infrastructure sitting in your data center for months because everybody thinks it's someone else's job.

**The fix:** Assign a Decommission Project Manager.

This is a REAL PROJECT with:
- Timeline
- Budget
- Resources
- Stakeholders
- Deliverables

Treat it like one.

## The Conversation Finance Needs to Hear

Next time Finance celebrates the "Retire" R during application rationalization:

**Finance:** "We're retiring 100 apps instead of migrating them! That's saving us millions in migration costs!"

**You:** "Great. What's the decommission budget?"

**Finance:** "Decommission budget? We're SAVING money by not migrating them."

**You:** "Those 100 apps run on physical hardware. That hardware needs to be:
- Verified as actually unused (nobody lied on the survey)
- Gracefully shut down (with rollback plans)
- Data archived or destroyed (compliance)
- Physically removed from racks (labor)
- Data destruction certified (regulations)
- Disposed of properly (e-waste)
- Contracts canceled (procurement)

All of that takes about 6 months and costs $300K+. When do you want to schedule the project kickoff?"

**Finance:** "..."

**You:** "Also, those servers we bought for $400K five years ago? They're worth about $10K now. So we're actually paying disposal fees. Should I get quotes for the roll-off dumpster?"

**Finance:** "The WHAT?"

**You:** "The dumpster. For the servers. They're e-waste. We need a certified disposal vendor. Also, better have a yard sale first, but nobody's going to show up because 5-year-old servers are worthless."

**Finance:** "This wasn't in the business case."

**You:** "No. It never is."

---

## The Yard Sale and Roll-Off Reality

**If you're going to Azure, better have:**

### The Yard Sale
- ITAD vendor quotes
- Hardware inventory (serial numbers, ages, condition)
- Realistic expectations (5-year-old servers = 2% of purchase price)
- Acceptance that you're not recovering meaningful value

### The Roll-Off
- E-waste disposal vendor
- Data destruction certification
- Compliance documentation
- Budget for $50-100 per drive for destruction
- Dumpster rental (literal dumpster for worthless hardware)

### The Timeline
- 6 months minimum for proper decommissioning
- Not "just turn them off"
- Real project with real costs

### The Budget
- $200K-500K for 100 retired applications
- Not savings, actual cost
- Finance needs to plan for this

## What Nobody Tells You

**The Azure migration is the easy part.**

Rehosting 100 apps? That's lift-and-shift. Cloud team knows how to do that.

**The hard part is what comes AFTER:**

Decommissioning 100 retired applications means:
- Coordinating physical removal across multiple data centers
- Managing data destruction compliance
- Handling e-waste disposal regulations
- Canceling contracts that nobody remembered we had
- Dealing with zombie infrastructure that nobody wants to be responsible for
- Spending money to dispose of hardware that's worthless

**And Finance never budgets for it because the word "Retire" sounds like a decision, not a project.**

---

## The Bottom Line

Application rationalization is great. The 6 R's framework helps you make good decisions about which apps to migrate, modernize, or retire.

**But when Finance celebrates the "Retire" R, make sure they understand:**

**"Retire" doesn't mean:**
- Stop paying for it immediately ✅
- Instant cost savings ✅
- No work required ✅

**"Retire" means:**
- 6-month decommissioning project
- $200K-500K in labor, disposal, and service costs
- Zombie infrastructure running for months while you figure it out
- A yard sale where nobody shows up
- A roll-off dumpster for $400K worth of hardware that's now worth $10K
- Someone has to actually OWN the decommission project

**Next time Finance asks about your Azure migration budget, include a line item:**

**"Decommissioning: $300,000"**

When they ask why, tell them:

**"Yard sale and roll-off rental. Trust me."**

Because if you're going to Azure, you'd better have both ready.
