![CAF Roles Matrix](/static/images/caf-roles-matrix.png)

This is the **condensed version** of my IT roles & responsibilities matrix â€” simplified so you can copy it straight into your wiki or runbooks.

It fills a real gap: Microsoftâ€™s [Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) defines **functions** (Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt, Govern, Manage) but doesnâ€™t give you a practical RACI or matrix. This post bridges that gap with a ready-to-use tool.
