This is the complete guide to building **enterprise-grade Terraform CI/CD pipelines** in Azure DevOps. Not theory - this is the exact setup I run in production.


This guide is part of our [Azure Governance hub](/hub/governance/) covering policy enforcement, compliance frameworks, and enterprise controls.

## Why This Series Exists

Most Terraform tutorials show you `terraform apply` from your laptop. Great for learning. Useless for production.

This series covers:
- ✅ **GitOps workflow** - All changes through Git and pull requests
- ✅ **Automated validation** - Status checks on every PR
- ✅ **Human approval gates** - Two-stage approval before deployment
- ✅ **Secret management** - Zero secrets in code, everything in Key Vault
- ✅ **Multi-environment setup** - Dev/Test/Prod with separate state files
- ✅ **Production hardening** - Drift detection, deployment windows, rollback strategies
- ✅ **Troubleshooting** - Real production issues and proven solutions

## The Complete Series

### Part 1: Prerequisites & Architecture
**[Read Part 1](/blog/terraform-azure-devops-cicd-part1-prerequisites/)**

What you'll build:
- Azure Storage Account for remote state backend
- Azure Key Vault for secret management
- Service Principal for Azure DevOps authentication
- Service connections and variable groups
- Terraform configuration files

**Key takeaway:** One-time manual setup that enables secure, auditable deployments.

---

### Part 2: Build Pipelines (Status Check & Plan)
**[Read Part 2](/blog/terraform-azure-devops-cicd-part2-build-pipelines/)**

What you'll build:
- **Terraform Status Check** pipeline (runs on PRs)
- **Terraform Plan** pipeline (creates deployment artifacts)
- GUI-based classic pipelines (no YAML required)
- Automated validation workflow

**Key takeaway:** Two pipelines serve different purposes - status checks provide fast feedback, plan pipelines create deployment artifacts.

---

### Part 3: Release Pipeline & Approval Gates
**[Read Part 3](/blog/terraform-azure-devops-cicd-part3-release-pipeline/)**

What you'll build:
- Release pipeline with pre-deployment approval gates
- Terraform apply using approved plan artifacts
- Email notifications for approvals and deployments
- Complete audit trail

**Key takeaway:** Approval gates prevent unauthorized infrastructure changes. What gets approved is exactly what deploys.

---

### Part 4: Branch Policies & Pull Request Automation
**[Read Part 4](/blog/terraform-azure-devops-cicd-part4-branch-policies/)**

What you'll build:
- Branch policies that enforce pull request workflow
- Required reviewers and status checks
- Automated validation on every PR
- Clean Git history with squash merges

**Key takeaway:** Branch policies make it impossible to bypass reviews and automated validation.

---

### Part 5: Production Best Practices & Multi-Environment Setup
**[Read Part 5](/blog/terraform-azure-devops-cicd-part5-production-best-practices/)**

What you'll build:
- Dev/Test/Prod environment separation
- State file isolation (one per environment)
- Environment-specific approval workflows
- Drift detection and deployment windows
- Rollback strategies

**Key takeaway:** Scale from single environment to enterprise-grade multi-environment infrastructure.

---

### Part 6: Troubleshooting & Common Production Issues
**[Read Part 6](/blog/terraform-azure-devops-cicd-part6-troubleshooting/)**

What you'll learn:
- Authentication and permission issues
- State file corruption and locking
- Resource drift detection and remediation
- Pipeline performance optimization
- Real production war stories

**Key takeaway:** These are real issues I've encountered in production with proven solutions.

## The Complete Workflow

Here's what happens when you deploy infrastructure with this setup:

```
1. Developer creates feature branch
   ↓
2. Write Terraform code in VSCode
   ↓
3. Commit → Push to Azure DevOps
   ↓
4. Create Pull Request
   ↓
5. [AUTOMATED] Status check pipeline runs
   ├─ terraform init
   ├─ terraform validate
   └─ terraform plan (display output)
   ↓
6. [HUMAN] Code review & approval
   ↓
7. Merge to main (squash commit)
   ↓
8. [AUTOMATED] Build pipeline runs
   ├─ terraform plan
   └─ Create artifact (.tfplan file)
   ↓
9. [HUMAN] Release approval gate
   ├─ Review plan artifact
   └─ Approve deployment
   ↓
10. [AUTOMATED] Release pipeline runs
    └─ terraform apply (using artifact)
    ↓
11. Azure Resources Deployed ✓
```

**Key principle:** Every infrastructure change goes through:
- Automated validation (syntax, plan output)
- Human review (code review)
- Human approval (deployment approval)

## Why GUI Pipelines (Not YAML)?

I use **classic GUI pipelines** instead of YAML pipelines for these reasons:

1. **Visual debugging** - See task order and configuration at a glance
2. **Easier troubleshooting** - Click into tasks, see logs, no YAML syntax errors
3. **Better for teams** - Non-developers can understand and modify pipelines
4. **Full feature parity** - GUI pipelines support all the same features
5. **Approval gates** - Native support in release pipelines

**YAML is great for:**
- Version controlling pipeline definitions
- GitOps for pipeline-as-code
- Complex matrix builds

**GUI is great for:**
- Deployment pipelines with approval workflows
- Visual pipeline management
- Teams that prefer clicking over YAML

Your choice. Both work. I prefer GUI for deployment workflows.

## What Makes This Production-Ready?

**Security:**
- ✅ No secrets in Git (all in Key Vault)
- ✅ Service principal with least-privilege permissions
- ✅ Approval gates prevent unauthorized deployments
- ✅ Complete audit trail (who, what, when, why)

**Reliability:**
- ✅ State file backups with versioning
- ✅ State locking prevents concurrent modifications
- ✅ Plan artifacts ensure consistency (what's approved is what deploys)
- ✅ Drift detection catches manual portal changes

**Scalability:**
- ✅ Separate state files per environment
- ✅ Modular Terraform code
- ✅ Performance optimized for large deployments
- ✅ Multi-environment promotion workflow (dev → test → prod)

**Compliance:**
- ✅ SOC 2 compliant audit trails
- ✅ Change advisory board (CAB) approval workflows
- ✅ Deployment windows restrict when changes can occur
- ✅ Rollback procedures documented and tested

## My Background

I'm an Azure Architect who builds and maintains production infrastructure for a financial services company. I can't use LinkedIn because of my employer (Synovus), so this blog is my portfolio.

**Why trust this guide?**
- This is my actual production setup (not theoretical)
- I've run this workflow for 2+ years
- I've troubleshot every issue in Part 6 (multiple times)
- I've trained teams on this exact process

**What I don't cover:**
- Terraform basics (plenty of good tutorials exist)
- Azure fundamentals (assume you know Azure)
- YAML pipelines (I use GUI pipelines by choice)

## Who This Series Is For

**You should read this if:**
- ✅ You're managing Azure infrastructure
- ✅ You want to move from manual deployments to automation
- ✅ You need audit trails for compliance
- ✅ You're building an enterprise deployment pipeline
- ✅ You want approval workflows and governance

**This might not be for you if:**
- ❌ You're just learning Terraform (start with official tutorials)
- ❌ You're deploying to AWS or GCP (this is Azure-specific)
- ❌ You prefer YAML pipelines (this uses GUI pipelines)
- ❌ You're running hobby projects (this is enterprise-focused)

## Time Commitment

**Full implementation:** 2-3 weeks

**Breakdown:**
- Part 1 (Prerequisites): 4-6 hours
- Part 2 (Build pipelines): 3-4 hours
- Part 3 (Release pipeline): 2-3 hours
- Part 4 (Branch policies): 1-2 hours
- Part 5 (Multi-environment): 5-7 hours
- Part 6 (Troubleshooting): Ongoing

**Maintenance:** ~2 hours/month
- Secret rotation
- Provider upgrades (test in dev first)
- Pipeline optimization
- Drift investigation

## Common Questions

**Q: Why not use GitHub Actions instead of Azure DevOps?**

A: GitHub Actions is great. I use Azure DevOps because:
- Native integration with Azure (service connections)
- Better approval workflows (release pipelines)
- Artifact management built-in
- My company already uses Azure DevOps

**Q: Can I use YAML pipelines instead of GUI pipelines?**

A: Yes. The concepts are identical, just different configuration format. YAML gives you version control for pipeline definitions. GUI gives you visual debugging. Pick what works for your team.

**Q: How much does this cost to run?**

A: **Almost free.**
- Azure DevOps: Free for up to 5 users
- Azure Pipelines: Free tier includes 1,800 minutes/month
- Storage account: <$5/month
- Key Vault: <$1/month
- Service principal: Free

**Total: ~$6/month for the infrastructure.** Your Azure resources cost extra.

**Q: What if I'm the only person on my team?**

A: This workflow still works. You'll approve your own PRs and releases. The value is in the audit trail, automated validation, and preventing accidental `terraform destroy` commands.

**Q: Can I use this with Terraform Cloud instead of remote state in Azure?**

A: Yes, but you'll need to adjust the backend configuration. The rest of the workflow remains the same.

**Q: How do I migrate existing infrastructure to this workflow?**

A: See Part 6 (Troubleshooting) for the import process. High-level:
1. Import existing resources into state
2. Write Terraform code to match current state
3. Test in dev environment first
4. Gradually migrate resources

## What's Next?
