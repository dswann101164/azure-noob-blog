<span class="lead"><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A practical, CAF-aligned roles & responsibilities matrix you can drop straight into your runbooks. Download it as PDF or Excel and adapt to your org.</span>


This guide is part of our [Azure Governance hub](/hub/governance/) covering policy enforcement, compliance frameworks, and enterprise controls.

It fills a real gap: Microsoft's [Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) defines **functions** (Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt, Govern, Manage) but doesn't give you a practical RACI or matrix.  
This post bridges that gap with a ready-to-use tool.

| **Plan**     | Rationalize apps, migration waves, skills readiness | Program Manager, Project Manager |
| **Ready**    | Landing zone, identity, networking, governance setup | Azure Admin, Platform Engineer |
| **Adopt**    | Migration execution, DevOps pipelines, workload onboarding | DevOps Engineer, App Owners |
| **Govern**   | Policy, compliance, security guardrails, cost mgmt | Security Engineer, Compliance Officer |
| **Manage**   | Operations, monitoring, patching, incident response | Help Desk, Ops Engineer, Service Owner |

## How this maps to Microsoft's CAF

CAF defines six functions across the adoption lifecycle — **Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt, Govern, Manage** — but stops short of a practical RACI.  
This matrix fills that gap by mapping common **IT roles** to CAF responsibilities so you can assign ownership decisively.
