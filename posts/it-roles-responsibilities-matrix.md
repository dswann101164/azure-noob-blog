![CAF Roles Matrix](/static/images/hero/caf-roles-matrix.png)

> **TL;DR:** A practical, CAF-aligned roles & responsibilities matrix you can drop straight into your runbooks. Download it as PDF or Excel and adapt to your org.

It fills a real gap: Microsoft’s [Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) defines **functions** (Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt, Govern, Manage) but doesn’t give you a practical RACI or matrix.  
This post bridges that gap with a ready-to-use tool.

### How this maps to Microsoft’s CAF

CAF defines six functions across the adoption lifecycle — **Strategy, Plan, Ready, Adopt, Govern, Manage** — but stops short of a practical RACI.  
This matrix fills that gap by mapping common **IT roles** to CAF responsibilities so you can assign ownership decisively.
