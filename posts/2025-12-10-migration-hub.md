# ☁️ Enterprise Migration Reality


This guide is part of our [Azure Governance hub](/hub/governance/) covering policy enforcement, compliance frameworks, and enterprise controls.

**The unfiltered guide to Azure migrations that actually work.**

Most Azure migration content focuses on the technical how-to. This hub addresses the **organizational, financial, and operational reality** that determines whether migrations succeed or fail.

If you're planning, executing, or recovering from an Azure migration—this is your reference library.

## 📋 Start Here: Pre-Migration Planning

**Before you migrate anything, answer these questions:**

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #0078d4; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">

### **[Why Most Azure Migrations Fail: The Pre-Migration Reality Check](/blog/cloud-migration-reality-check/)**

**The 55-question application questionnaire Microsoft doesn't give you.**

- How many applications do we actually have?
- Who owns each application?
- Where are the installation media?
- Can we even prove we own the licenses?

**If you can't answer 50% with high confidence, you're not ready to migrate.**

**Download:** Excel questionnaire template  
**Time investment:** 2-4 weeks of discovery  
**Money saved:** $500K-$2M in avoided migration failures

## 💰 Migration ROI & Financial Reality

**Finance will ask: "What's the ROI?" Here's how to answer.**

### **[Why Your Azure Migration ROI Calculation Is Wrong](/blog/azure-migration-roi-wrong/)**

**Finance compares server costs. That's not what changes.**

What actually changes:
- 6-month procurement cycles → Same-day provisioning
- VAR meetings eliminated
- Hardware refresh projects eliminated
- CapEx approval barriers removed
- Marketplace software procurement in minutes

**The real ROI:** Business agility, not server savings.

### **[Azure Hybrid Benefit: The $50K Licensing Mistake](/blog/azure-hybrid-benefit-licensing-mistake/)**

**Most enterprises accidentally trigger $50K+ audit penalties by misusing Azure Hybrid Benefit.**

Common mistakes:
- Applying AHB without active Software Assurance
- No proof of purchase documentation
- Wrong core-to-VM mapping
- Double-paying on marketplace images

**5-question checklist before enabling AHB.**

## ⚠️ Common Migration Failures

### **[Why Most Azure Migrations Fail](/blog/why-most-azure-migrations-fail/)**

**The organizational problems that kill migrations before they start.**

Real failure patterns:
- Migrating applications nobody uses ($32K wasted)
- Lost installation media (can't rebuild)
- No business owner (nobody to approve)
- Vendor licensing restrictions ($75K surprise)
- Certificate expirations (12 days downtime)
- Compliance violations ($95K remediation)

**Each mistake has the same root cause: Incomplete discovery.**

### **[Azure Migration Yard Sale Rolloff](/blog/azure-migration-yard-sale-rolloff/)**

**What happens when you skip rationalization and just "migrate everything."**

The pattern:
- Lift-and-shift 500 VMs to Azure
- Discover 40% were unused
- Spend months identifying retirement candidates
- Post-migration cleanup costs more than migration

**Rationalize BEFORE migrating, not after.**

## 🔧 Migration Execution

### **[Azure Migrate: Enterprise Hybrid Reality](/blog/azure-migrate-enterprise-hybrid/)**

**How Azure Migrate actually works in complex enterprise environments.**

Covers:
- Discovery across multiple VMware environments
- Dependency mapping at scale
- Assessment accuracy and limitations
- Migration wave planning
- Post-migration validation

**Azure Migrate is excellent—when you use it correctly.**

## 📊 Cost Management Post-Migration

**You migrated. Now what does it cost?**

### **[Azure FinOps 2025: Complete Guide](/blog/azure-finops-complete-guide/)**

**How to actually understand and control Azure costs.**

Covers:
- Tag governance (the 247 variations problem)
- Application-level cost visibility
- Chargeback models that business units accept
- Shared services allocation
- What optimization actually works

**FinOps isn't about cutting costs. It's about understanding them.**

[Read the FinOps guide →](/blog/azure-finops-complete-guide/)

### **[Azure Tagging Best Practices 2025](/blog/azure-resource-tags-guide/)**

**Tag governance is the foundation of cost allocation.**

The mistakes that break reporting:
- 247 variations of "Production"
- Missing cost center tags
- No enforcement via Azure Policy
- Retrofit tagging after migration

**Get tagging right BEFORE migration, not after.**

## 🎓 Migration Lessons Learned

### **[The Institutional Knowledge Problem](/blog/why-most-azure-migrations-fail/#the-institutional-knowledge-problem)**

**When the person who knew how things work left 3 years ago.**

What you lose:
- Application architecture knowledge
- Vendor relationships
- License agreement details
- Certificate locations
- Integration dependencies

**Document everything like everyone is leaving tomorrow.**

### **[PowerShell 7 Enterprise Migration](/blog/powershell-7-enterprise-migration/)**

**Migrating enterprise PowerShell scripts to Azure automation.**

Covers:
- PowerShell 5.1 vs 7.x differences

## 💡 Key Principles

**From 31,000+ resources across 44 subscriptions in regulated banking:**

1. **Discovery before migration** - Can't migrate what you don't understand
2. **Rationalize before rehosting** - 20-40% should be retired, not migrated
3. **Document institutional knowledge** - People leave, documentation stays
4. **Validate licenses BEFORE migrating** - $50K audit penalties are real
5. **Tag during migration** - Retroactive tagging costs 10x more
6. **ROI isn't server costs** - It's procurement cycles eliminated
7. **Plan for the 6-month audit** - Microsoft will verify your AHB usage
8. **Applications without owners** - Are retirement candidates, not migration candidates

## 🚀 Migration Roadmap

**Phase 1: Discovery (Months 1-3)**
- Deploy Azure Migrate for technical discovery
- Complete 55-question questionnaire per application
- Identify retirement candidates
- Map dependencies

**Phase 2: Rationalization (Months 3-4)**
- Decide 7R action per application (Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild, Replace, Retire, Retain)
- Calculate actual costs (including all hidden costs)
- Validate licensing compliance
- Get business owner approval

**Phase 3: Planning (Months 4-6)**
- Design landing zones
- Implement tag governance
- Configure compliance policies
- Prepare migration waves

**Phase 4: Pilot (Months 6-9)**
- Migrate 5-10 low-risk applications
- Validate approach
- Document lessons learned
- Adjust process

**Phase 5: Execution (Months 9-24)**
- Wave-based migrations
- Post-migration validation
- Cost optimization
- Continuous improvement

**Realistic timeline: 18-24 months for 100+ applications**

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can we accelerate the timeline?**  
A: Yes, if you skip discovery and pay 2x later when things break.

**Q: Do we need consultants?**  
A: For complex migrations, yes. For organizational readiness, no—use the questionnaire.

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**  
A: Migrating applications you should have retired instead.

**Q: How much will Azure cost vs. on-premises?**  
A: Compute might be 30% more, but procurement cycles are eliminated. ROI is operational, not per-VM.

**Q: Should we use Azure Hybrid Benefit?**  
A: Only if you have active SA, proof of purchase, and correct core mapping. Read the licensing guide first.
