Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) is supposed to save money — not **trigger a $50,000 audit bill**.

But that's exactly what happens inside enterprise environments every single year.

The mistake is simple, predictable, and embarrassingly common:

> **Enterprises assume their on-prem Windows Server and SQL Server licenses automatically give them cloud usage rights.**

They don't.

And when auditors show up six months after your migration, the bill they bring isn't "oops money."  
It's **real money** — often north of $50K.

This post explains **why** it happens, **how** to prevent it, and provides the **8-question pre-migration AHB validation checklist** every Azure admin should complete before touching that toggle.
