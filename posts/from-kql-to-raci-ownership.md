We've all been there.

You run the KQL query. You find the $5,000/month VM that has 1% CPU usage. You triumphantly email the team.

And... nothing happens.

Six months later, the VM is still there.

### The Authority Gap

This is the Authority Gap. 

**Code (KQL)** gives you *Visibility*.
**Process (RACI)** gives you *Authority*.

You cannot code your way out of a political problem. Identifying waste is a technical task. Executing the deletion is a political act.

### The "Scream Test" is Not Governance

If your current process for checking if a server is needed is "turn it off and see who screams," you don't have governance. You have anxiety.

A RACI model defines **Accountability**. When you ask "Can I delete this?", the **'Resource Owner'** is the *only* person who needs to answer. If they don't answer, the **'Process Owner'** defines the timeout period before automatic deletion.

### Bridge the Gap

Don't just be the person who sends the charts. Be the person who stops the bill.
