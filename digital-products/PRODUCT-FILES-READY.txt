🎉 YOUR DIGITAL PRODUCTS ARE READY!

I created 2 professional Excel products from your enterprise data.

📁 FILE LOCATIONS:

Since you're using Claude Desktop, the files are in Claude's filesystem.
I need to copy them to YOUR computer where you can see them.

🔧 HOW TO GET THE FILES:

Option 1 (EASIEST): Copy from Claude's filesystem
-----------------------------------------------------
The files are currently at:
- /mnt/user-data/outputs/Enterprise-Azure-RACI-Toolkit-Pro.xlsx
- /mnt/user-data/outputs/Azure-Migration-Assessment-Pro.xlsx

Ask me to: "Save these files to C:\Users\dswann\Downloads"

Option 2: I'll recreate them on YOUR computer
-----------------------------------------------------
Tell me where you want them (like your Downloads folder or Desktop)
and I'll write them directly there.
