- **Optimistic:** $994 + $380 + $970 = **$2,344/month**

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### What Will Make This Work:

1. **Build the $497 Calculator FAST:**
   - Don't overthink it
   - Excel with live formulas = good enough
   - Ship in 4-6 hours, iterate based on buyer feedback

2. **Email List Consistency:**
   - 100+ emails/month minimum
   - 5-email automation sequence converts free → paid
   - Nurture list with weekly value (not pitches)

3. **Google Search Console Monitoring:**
   - Watch "Azure OpenAI Pricing" position weekly
   - Target: Position 12 → Position 8 in 30 days
   - If CTR doesn't improve by Day 14, revise meta description

4. **Gumroad Analytics:**
   - Track product page views vs conversions
   - If views are high but conversions low → pricing problem
   - If views are low → traffic problem (SEO not working)

### What Will Kill This:

❌ Overthinking the calculator ("It needs to be perfect!")
❌ Not building Gumroad products (marketing without products = 0 sales)
❌ Ignoring email list (list = long-term revenue engine)
❌ Waiting for "perfect" before deploying
